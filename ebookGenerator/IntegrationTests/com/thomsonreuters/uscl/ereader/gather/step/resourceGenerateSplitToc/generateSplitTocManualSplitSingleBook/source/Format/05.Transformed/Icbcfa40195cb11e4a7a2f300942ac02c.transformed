As always, my family has been supportive and encouraging. My friends have excused my occasional preoccupation with reading Panel decisions and writing up these developments. I continue to be indebted to my law partners and my law firm, Maslon LLP, for their support, advice, and assistance. Our clients have provided the wonderful and rich education in complex litigation in many state and federal courts. I am honored to be able to help solve the litigation problems they have faced.</div></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">Lynnette Shanahan, Patricia Porter, and Dixie Rud, and now Michelle Moszer, have provided able assistance in putting these materials on paper. As always, I also appreciate the sacrifices and forbearances of my family.</div></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">The Panel Clerk's office has been a tremendous resource for making this book more useful to those who practice before the Panel. The former Clerk of the Panel, Jeffery N. Lüthi, continued in the fine tradition of the office, and shared useful insights into the work of the Panel. The former Clerk of the Panel, Michael J. Beck, similarly provided invaluable assistance and guidance in the preparation of this book. This assistance is typical of that offered to all litigants with matters before the Panel. It is especially appreciated by this author. Patricia Howard, who served from the Panel's inception until early 1999, was similarly helpful. John W. Nichols now serves the Panel as its Clerk. </div></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">It should go without saying, but any errors that remain are my sole responsibility. If you find one, please let me know so I can fix it.</div></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">David F.

The Panel exists to decide a single question: Where can cases pending in more than one district best be heard for pretrial proceedings? Its members include judges from around the country who already have one full-time job as district or circuit judge. The Panel handles thousands of cases and provides one of the most important means of efficient and fair case management in the federal judiciary. It regularly meets for one day of hearings a month and has, since its inception, handled over 2,700 separate dockets and tens of thousands of cases.</div></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">This work is in some ways the reincarnation of my earlier work on the Panel, <span class="co_smallCaps">Multidistrict Litigation</span>, published in 1985 and long out of print. This new work covers the ascendent role of the Panel and many of its significant accomplishments during the past decades and provides detailed annotations to the Multidistrict Litigation statute, <a id="co_link_I8ab363e0abfd11eb86bfb248cee5f00c" class="co_link co_drag ui-draggable" href="https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=L&amp;pubNum=1000546&amp;cite=28USCAS1407&amp;originatingDoc=Icbcfa40195cb11e4a7a2f300942ac02c&amp;refType=LQ&amp;originationContext=ebook&amp;RS=ebbp3.0&amp;vr=3.0">28 U.S.C.A. § 1407</a>. The Panel is publishing many of its decisions, and this work reviews those decisions and analyzes and explains the ins and outs of practice before the Panel. The Panel continues to play a central role in complex, multidistrict litigation, and recent legislation, including the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, only enhances its ability to manage litigation.</div></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">This book is intended to provide guidance for the lawyer or party who faces the potential transfer of a case filed in the home district and now subject to transfer anywhere in the country. Because of the fundamentally practical nature of the Panel's mission, this book tries to answer as many of the practical questions litigants face. It is not a scholarly treatise—it is without apology a practice manual. In some cases, all this book may do is guide the reader to the Panel Rule that answers the question.</div></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">Thanks to the following lawyers and judges who have made thoughtful comments and suggestions for the improvement of this Manual.</div></div><div id="co_anchor_I18619780822411e48893910b0d614351"><table><?startUnchunkableBlock N1010A_header?><tr><td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3 " style="width:38%"> </td><td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3 " style="width:63%"> </td></tr><?endUnchunkableBlock N1010A_header?><tr><td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3 " style="width:38%"> </td><td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3 " style="width:63%"> </td></tr><?startUnchunkableBlock N1010A_trailer?><tr><td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3 " style="width:38%"> </td><td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3 " style="width:63%"> </td></tr><tr><td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3 " style="width:38%"> </td><td class="co_hAlign1 co_vAlign3 " style="width:63%"> </td></tr><?endUnchunkableBlock N1010A_trailer?></table></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">Keep those cards and letters coming!</div></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">Any suggestions for future editions will be appreciated.
