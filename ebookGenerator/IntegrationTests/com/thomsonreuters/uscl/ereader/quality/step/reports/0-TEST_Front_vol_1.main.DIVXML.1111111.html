LUNN retired from the bench on December 31, 2008, and is now a partner in the Trevett Cristo law firm in Rochester, N.Y. He served as an assistant district attorney for Monroe County in 1976 and 1977 and was in private practice through 1994 when he was elected to the New York State Supreme Court. In August 2005, he was appointed by New York Gov. George Pataki to the Appellate Division, Second Department, in New York City and in December 2006 he was appointed by the governor to the Appellate Division, Fourth Department, in Rochester, N.Y. Justice Lunn received his juris doctor from Cornell Law School in 1974 and a B.A. in history from the University of Rochester in 1969. He has authored or co-authored three separate books for the trial bar and judicial bench, all published by West. Justice Lunn wrote a biweekly column for the New York Daily Record. He is a past member of the New York Pattern Jury Instructions Committee. Lunn has lectured on trial matters for the New York State Bar Association, local bar associations, and the New York State Academy of Trial Lawyers.PREFACEThis is intended to be a practical book about a scholarly resource, New York Pattern Jury Instructions (&ldquo;NY PJI&rdquo;). The utility of NY PJI goes well beyond the drafting of jury instructions. The purpose of this handbook is to make NY PJI more accessible and useful as a research reference and case planning resource.Part I of the book seeks to explain why NY PJI should be used by lawyers as a planning tool, and then to show how it can be deployed as such in several different types of civil cases. In Sections 1:1 and 1:3, covering the history of NY PJI and suggesting that lawyers know in advance how they want to finish, and in his illuminating &ldquo;View from the Bench&rdquo; comments, Justice Lunn has given us the benefit of his vast knowledge experience as a former member of the Committee on Pattern Jury Instructions, as a trial and appellate judge, and as a practicing attorney.The remainder of Part I is essentially an exploration of the content of NY PJI &ndash; both the instructions themselves and the extensive comments of the Committee &ndash; from the point of view of an attorney evaluating or litigating a particular matter. Its purpose will have been achieved if you find yourself pleasantly surprised at the wide range of issues covered in the pages of NY PJI, and if you resolve to take advantage of it as a research resource.Part II provides Finding Aids to facilitate access to NY PJI Comments, as well as a sampling of actual jury charges and charge requests, interspersed with Author&rsquo;s Comments. Part II is arranged by substantive area. Generally, the comments seek to link the actual charges or charge requests to related discussion in NY PJI. Notably, Part II includes some &ldquo;requested&rdquo; charges as well as some that were actually given.It is important to understand that the actual charges or charge requests included in Part II are simply a reality test; they are emphatically not intended to function as recommended models for a practitioner who happens to have a case similar to the one presented. The intent is just to draw upon documents that have been filed in actual cases (and that can be accessed via Westlaw) and to learn what can be learned from them.Similarly, it is important for a reader to keep in mind that the Pattern Jury Instructions are constantly being revised and updated. A charge that was identical to one of the pattern charges when given or proposed may no longer be so. Any Author&rsquo;s Comments should be understood to be respectfully submitted. It is the Author&rsquo;s responsibility to editorialize, but it is not the Author&rsquo;s intent to pass judgment on those who prepared, approved, or disapproved the jury charges discussed. While this book of necessity draws heavily on NY PJI, it is not a part of NY PJI and its text has not been approved, sanctioned, or endorsed by the authors of NY PJI.FOREWORDMichael A. Rosenhouse and Justice Robert J. Lunn are to be thanked and congratulated for providing the New York legal community with this handbook. Trial lawyers have long recognized that the New York Pattern Jury Instructions&mdash;Civil (&ldquo;NY PJI&rdquo;) are indispensable in preparing jury charges for submission to the Court. However, fewer lawyers recognize the other important uses of NY PJI long before trial. The point of this book is that NY PJI should be used from the day the case first comes in the door.Author Michael Rosenhouse has written a handbook that contains practical guidance about how to use NY PJI to its greatest effect. He explains in detail how to use the NY PJI in screening cases, in determining the applicable statute of limitations, determining what the elements of the case are and projecting damages. He also explains in detail how to use NY PJI to draft the pleadings, prepare discovery, prepare for trial and do openings and closings, all of which are not typical uses made by most lawyers. In addition, he explains in detail how to use NY PJI to prepare jury charges and verdict sheets. In other words, this handbook shows how to maximize the use of NY PJI to its fullest extent.Justice Lunn brings his rich experience and insight to this handbook in Sections 1:1 and 1:3, and in commentaries that provide a View From The Bench. He was a practicing trial lawyer in civil and criminal courts for nearly twenty years, and enjoyed an excellent reputation. As a trial judge in New York&rsquo;s Supreme Court, Seventh Judicial District, he brought to bear his trial experience, his knowledge of the law and judgment to be an outstanding trial judge. Many of the people who practiced before him regretted when he was elevated to the Appellate Division because they did not want to lose him and his ability to handle trials. Since August 2005 Justice Lunn has served on the Appellate Division&rsquo;s Second Department and more recently the Appellate Division, Fourth Department, again with distinction. He is particularly knowledgeable about NY PJI because he is a past member of the Committee on Pattern Jury Instructions, Association of Justices of the Supreme Court of the State of New York. He is also a former contributing editor and writer for the New York Bench Book for Trial Judges, all of which gives him a rich background for this publication.A particularly novel aspect of the handbook is the use of illustrative cases showing the type of case, the results, and actual or proposed jury instructions. These illustrations are provided in a broad array of cases including motor vehicle negligence, medical malpractice, premises liability, products liability, construction accidents, intentional torts and contracts.In short, this book should be put with NY PJI on every trial lawyer&rsquo;s book shelf in New York and consulted on each case.A.

He is also a former contributing editor and writer for the New York Bench Book for Trial Judges, all of which gives him a rich background for this publication.A particularly novel aspect of the handbook is the use of illustrative cases showing the type of case, the results, and actual or proposed jury instructions. These illustrations are provided in a broad array of cases including motor vehicle negligence, medical malpractice, premises liability, products liability, construction accidents, intentional torts and contracts.In short, this book should be put with NY PJI on every trial lawyer&rsquo;s book shelf in New York and consulted on each case.A.
