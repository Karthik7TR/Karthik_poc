There were as yet no polygraphers and no developed market for their services. There might never be, if the only place that had any use for them was the courtroom, and if the only way to get into the courtroom was to gain prior marketplace acceptance.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_I127ff9304e8111e181c20000837bc6dd_N1009F"><a class="co_footnoteReference" href="#co_footnote_I127ff9304e8111e181c20000837bc6dd">2</a></sup> A novel scientific question presented itself and the conventional test offered no ready solution.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_I1280bc804e8111e181c20000837bc6dd_N100A5"><a class="co_footnoteReference" href="#co_footnote_I1280bc804e8111e181c20000837bc6dd">3</a></sup> The asserted expertise offered in Frye demanded a different test than the one that had served the law for so long.</div></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">Judge Van Orsdel found a solution that departed as little as possible from prior law. The entire Frye opinion occupied only two pages. The critical words are these:</div><blockquote><div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">Just when a scientific principle or discovery crosses the line between the experimental and demonstrable stages is difficult to define. Somewhere in this twilight zone the evidential force of the principle must be recognized, and while the courts will go a long way in admitting expert testimony deduced from a well-recognized scientific principle or discovery, the thing from which the deduction is made must be sufficiently established to have gained general acceptance in the particular field in which it belongs.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_I128158c04e8111e181c20000837bc6dd_N100C4"><a class="co_footnoteReference" href="#co_footnote_I128158c04e8111e181c20000837bc6dd">4</a></sup></div></div></div></blockquote></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">In one sense, this is nothing more than the familiar market test relocated into a different marketplace. Where there is no commercial market, and may never be one, the evaluation of the asserted expertise can be performed in the "field's" marketplace by those who trade there.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_I1281f5004e8111e181c20000837bc6dd_N100D4"><a class="co_footnoteReference" href="#co_footnote_I1281f5004e8111e181c20000837bc6dd">5</a></sup> The intellectual or professional marketplace was simply a proxy for the commercial marketplace. The test is still a marketplace test; the real evaluation still is conducted outside of the court or the law, and it still is incapable of distinguishing astrology from astronomy.</div></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">Yet, the Frye extrapolation did some new things. First, it separated the expertise from the expert, thereby creating legal accommodation to the notion that a body of asserted knowledge has an existence separate from any individual, no matter how brilliant, well-educated, or experienced that person might be, and that the body of asserted knowledge had to be evaluated apart from the individual who brings it to court. Second, of course, the alternative marketplace, the intellectual marketplace, allows more knowledge to be assessed, even if the knowledge is too new to be marketed commercially or if there is no hope of ever marketing it commercially.</div></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">Third—and most remarkable—as assessors of the value of what was being offered, Frye replaced buyers with sellers.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_I1282df604e8111e181c20000837bc6dd_N100F1"><a class="co_footnoteReference" href="#co_footnote_I1282df604e8111e181c20000837bc6dd">6</a></sup> The commercial marketplace test, even with its serious weaknesses, had the virtue of allowing buyers in the marketplace to be the authority on whether something was valuable and therefore "valid." Under the Frye variation, that control was passed to the people who produced the knowledge and offered it, and themselves, to the courts.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_I128354904e8111e181c20000837bc6dd_N100FA"><a class="co_footnoteReference" href="#co_footnote_I128354904e8111e181c20000837bc6dd">7</a></sup></div></div><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">Primarily, the "Frye test" was a minor adaptation of a major theme. For most kinds of expertise in most circumstances, the larger doctrine and the special situation would lead to the same result. So unimportant was the Frye extrapolation that it went unnoticed for decades. No contemporaneous law review articles were written about it and other courts did not cite it.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_I128417e04e8111e181c20000837bc6dd_N10110"><a class="co_footnoteReference" href="#co_footnote_I128417e04e8111e181c20000837bc6dd">8</a></sup> In fact, Frye only became fashionable in the 1970s as an argument arose over the admissibility of scientific evidence, perhaps in anticipation of the new Federal Rules of Evidence.<sup id="co_footnoteReference_I12848d104e8111e181c20000837bc6dd_N10116"><a class="co_footnoteReference" href="#co_footnote_I12848d104e8111e181c20000837bc6dd">9</a></sup></div></div></div><?chunkMarker?><div class="co_copyright">Westlaw. © 2011 Thomson Reuters.

Today, the polygraph has a highly developed market outside the courtroom. This market, however, as the chapter from Professors Iacono and Lykken argues, § 40:45, is not necessarily based on the utility of the technique in the courtroom. Polygraphs might serve a useful practical function—such as promoting confessions—that is substantially unrelated to their validity.</div></div></div></div><div><div class="co_footnoteNumber"><span id="co_footnote_I1280bc804e8111e181c20000837bc6dd"><a href="#co_footnoteReference_I1280bc804e8111e181c20000837bc6dd_N100A5">3</a></span></div><div class="co_footnoteBody"><div class="co_paragraph"><div class="co_paragraphText">The court in Frye may have had a second problem. Suppose it wanted to exclude the lie detection results, then and thereafter, even if some day such examiners did attain a commercial market and qualified polygraphers became plentiful. The most obvious reason a court might feel this way is that polygraph testing could become a major vehicle by which at least some defendants could make a jury feel there was reasonable doubt about guilt. This would not be easy in a legal world that, despite "constant complaining and mistrust" of experts, routinely admitted them—so long as they were "qualified" and William Marston, Frye's expert witness, was well qualified by conventional standards (if he actually had an expertise in the subject at issue). Marston was an attorney and research psychologist who had done a considerable amount of empirical research on the physiological correlates of lying. See William M. Marston, Systolic Blood Pressure Symptoms of Description, 2 J. Exper.

The latter part of the twentieth century has seen a weakening of the status of professions, and the most recent shifts in the rules of evidence may be seen to parallel the loss of autonomy of professions.
