				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="co_paragraph">
				<div class="co_paragraphText">Under the premium processing program, business petitioners may choose to pay a $1,225 fee to obtain expedited processing of their cases. Such cases must be adjudicated within 15 days. L-1 petitions filed on Form I-129 are eligible for expedited processing. Petitioners requesting premium processing must submit Form I-907 and the $1,225 fee required for such requests. The fee is separate from the standard filing fee for the I-129 petition described above. Form I-907, Request for Premium Processing Service, may be filed with a new application or petition, or filed separately for a pending application or petition. The premium processing fee must be paid by separate check or money order; do not include it in the same check as the usual filing fee for the I-129. If the I-907 is filed after the petition or application is filed, the 15 days will start to run when USCIS receives the form. When submitting a Form I-907 after a related petition, a copy of the receipt notice (Form I-797) should be included.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="co_paragraph">
				<div class="co_paragraphText">Note that cases that are eligible for premium processing (such as L-1 cases) will not be processed on an expedited basis unless the petitioner utilizes the premium processing program (and pays the required $1,225 fee). The only exception to this rule is with regard to nonprofit L-1 petitioners who may continue to utilize the informal expedite request procedures without payment of the premium processing fee. The standards and procedures for handling such requests are discussed in Ch 23, below.</div>
			</div>
			<div class="co_paragraph">
				<div class="co_paragraphText">Also note that there is a designated premium processing address at each center with a distinct Post Office box number, zip code, or other special designation. If the regular Service Center address is used, the 15-day period for premium processing will not start to run until USCIS identifies the case as a premium processing case. To minimize delays, therefore, petitioners should ensure that the designated address is used. E-mail addresses and telephone numbers are also available for each of the Service Centers to be used exclusively for inquiries about premium processing cases. The special addresses and phone numbers for each of the centers are listed in Ch 23, below.</div>

							<div class="co_paragraphText">USCIS has clarified its policy concerning attorneys signing Form I-907 premium processing requests on behalf of I-129 and I-140 petitioners. USCIS Service Centers will accept a Form I-907 that is signed by the attorney on behalf of the petitioner, provided that the underlying filing contains a properly signed I-129 and I-140 petition and a G-28 that is signed by the petitioner. No power of attorney is required in this situation. In contrast, a copy of a power of attorney must be included where the attorney is signing a petition or application as the petitioner or applicant. USCIS will reject petitions and applications that are signed by the attorney on behalf of the petitioner or applicant but that do not include a current power of attorney.</div>
						</div>
						<div class="co_paragraph">
							<div class="co_paragraphText">
								<strong>Signature of attorney/accredited representative.</strong> If the petitioner or applicant requesting premium processing is represented by an attorney/accredited representative and this person also signed the I-907 in Part 3 (as the authorized representative of the petitioner/applicant), check the box in Part 4 (“Same individual as signing above in Part 3”).<input type="hidden" id="co_docMarker_4"/> If this box is checked, then the attorney is not required to sign in Part 4 but the attorney must provide his or her firm name, address, and a daytime phone number. If the box in Part 4 is not checked but the attorney prepared the form on behalf of the petitioner/applicant, the attorney must sign and date this part and provide his or her firm name, address, and a daytime phone number. The instructions to the form state that this part must be signed if a G-28 is attached to this request unless the attorney has already signed the form in Part 3.</div>
						</div>
						<div class="co_paragraph">
							<div class="co_paragraphText">Under 1996 legislation it is a criminal offense to fail disclose a role in preparing or assisting in preparing an immigration-related document that is “falsely made”—that is, with knowledge or a reckless disregard of the fact that the document contains a false statement or material misrepresentation or has no basis in law or fact. Considering the significant penalty involved (five years of imprisonment and/or a substantial fine), the most cautious course of action is for any person who assisted in preparation of the form to include his or her name here (if more than one person assisted, an attachment can be included with the signatures of the other persons). Even when an attorney submits a notice of appearance on Form G-28 with the form, it is appropriate for the attorney to sign the form here as well. The preparer should also print his or her name, date the form, provide the name of his or her firm and address, and a daytime phone number. If the petitioner/applicant is represented by counsel who submits Form G-28, Notice of Appearance, any communications relating to the request will be sent to counsel.</div>
