However, in order to provide stability for those entering into the marriage relationship in good faith and to provide for an orderly determination of parentage and security for the children of the relationship, it is the policy of this state to preserve and uphold each marriage against claims of invalidity unless a strong reason exists for holding the marriage void or voidable.  Therefore, every marriage entered into in this state is presumed to be valid unless expressly made void by Chapter 6 or unless expressly made voidable by Chapter 6 and annulled as provided by that chapter.  <a id="co_link_I65ec4100bacf11ea9ab0d17fa9761b04" class="co_link co_drag ui-draggable" href="https://www.westlaw.com/Link/Document/FullText?findType=Y&amp;serNum=0000000000280582161&amp;pubNum=0134158&amp;originatingDoc=N2F75B1F0BE6F11D9BDF79F56AB79CECB-000010&amp;refType=DA&amp;originationContext=ebook&amp;RS=ebbp3.0&amp;vr=3.0">R.S.C. 1985, c.

Except as provided in §159.507, the provisions of this subchapter only apply to an interstate case and do not apply to an income-withholding order from a foreign country. While U.S. employers routinely enforce sister state income-withholding orders, enforcement of the wide variety of possible foreign support orders would provide too many complexities and challenges to justify requiring an employer to interpret and enforce an ostensible foreign income-withholding order. Indeed, income-withholding orders from a foreign country are quite rare at this time, although instances of that enforcement remedy probably will increase in the future. </div>  </div> <div> <h2 class="co_center">ANNOTATIONS</h2>  <h2 class="co_center">  <em>Generally</em>  </h2> <div class="co_indentTop co_indentParagraph">  <em> <strong>Texas Employers’ Ins. v. Elder</strong> </em>, 282 S.W.2d 371, 373 (Tex.1955). “The presumption in favor of the validity of a marriage which, as in this case, has been duly shown to have been contracted is one of the strongest, if, indeed, not the strongest, known to law. The presumption is, in itself, evidence, and may even outweigh positive evidence to the contrary. The strength of the presumption increases with the lapse of time, acknowledgments by the parties to the marriage, and the birth of children; and the fact that the legitimacy of a child may be involved is a factor in sustaining the validity of the marriage. It is well that the presumption should be so regarded, for it is grounded upon a sound public policy which favors morality, innocence, marriage, and legitimacy rather than immorality, guilt, concubinage, and bastardy.” (Internal quotes omitted.) </div> <div class="co_indentTop co_indentParagraph">  <em> <strong>Estate of Durrill</strong> </em>, 570 S.W.3d 945, 958 (Tex.App.—Corpus Christi 2019, no pet.). Alleged W “relies upon the Declaration [of informal marriage] as prima facie evidence of the marriage to invoke the separate presumption of validity. The presumption that a marriage is valid may also be rebutted. <em>At 960:</em> Although the Declaration may be some evidence that [alleged W and testator] were married ..., [alleged W] admitted that they did not hold themselves out to others as married at any time before November 2, 2015. [¶] Because [alleged W] admitted that she and [testator] did not hold themselves out as married to the community, there was no valid informal marriage before November 2, 2015, and thus, no presumption of validity of a marriage before that date.” </div> <div class="co_indentTop co_indentParagraph">  <em> <strong>Holick v. Smith</strong> </em>, 685 S.W.2d 18, 20 (Tex.1985). “The natural right existing between parents and their children is of constitutional dimensions. … A termination decree is complete, final, irrevocable and divests for all time that natural right as well as all legal rights, privileges, duties and powers with respect to each other except for the child’s right to inherit. … Consequently, termination proceedings should be strictly scrutinized, and involuntary termination statutes are strictly construed in favor of the parent.” </div>   <h2 class="co_center">  <em>Clear &amp; Convincing Evidence</em>  </h2> <div class="co_indentTop co_indentParagraph">  <em> <strong>In re N.G.</strong> </em>, __S.W.3d__, 2019 WL 2147263 (Tex.2019) (No. 18-0508; 5-17-19). “In parental termination cases, due process mandates a clear and convincing evidence standard of proof. ‘Due process compels this heightened standard because terminating the parent-child relationship imposes permanent, irrevocable consequences.’ ... Because of this high evidentiary burden at trial, we have concluded that appellate review in parental termination cases also warrants a heightened standard of review. Further, a parent must be permitted to appeal the termination of parental rights, and due process requires that the appeal be meaningful. [¶] [W]hen a court of appeals reverses a finding based on insufficient evidence, the court must ‘detail the evidence relevant to the issue of parental termination and clearly state why the evidence is insufficient to support a termination finding by clear and convincing evidence.’”  </div> <div class="co_indentTop co_indentParagraph">  <em> <strong>In re K.M.L.</strong> </em>, 443 S.W.3d 101, 112-13 (—Tex.2014). “Our traditional legal sufficiency—or ‘no evidence’—standard of review upholds a finding supported by ‘[a]nything more than a scintilla of evidence.’ However, ‘[r]equiring only anything more than a mere scintilla of evidence does not equate to clear and convincing evidence.’ Thus, our legal sufficiency review in a parental termination case must take into consideration whether the evidence is such that a factfinder could reasonably form a firm belief or conviction about the truth of the matter on which the State bears the burden of proof. [¶] In a legal sufficiency challenge, we credit evidence that supports the verdict if reasonable jurors could have done so and disregard contrary evidence unless reasonable jurors could not have done so. However, the reviewing court should not disregard undisputed facts that do not support the verdict to determine whether there is clear and convincing evidence. In cases requiring clear and convincing evidence, even evidence that does more than raise surmise and suspicion will not suffice unless that evidence is capable of producing a firm belief or conviction that the allegation is true. If the reviewing court determines that no reasonable factfinder could form a firm belief or conviction that the matter to be proven is true, then the court must conclude that the evidence is legally insufficient.” <em>See also </em> <em> <strong>In re E.N.C.</strong> </em>, 384 S.W.3d 796, 802-03 (—Tex.2012); <em> <strong>In re J.F.C.</strong> </em>, 96 S.W.3d 256, 265-66 (—Tex.2002). </div>  </div>   <div class="co_contentBlock co_briefItState co_includeCurrencyBlock" id="co_anchor_I612A33B0975911E9898AC5E1A2A08F91">    </div>     </div><div class="co_hAlign1"/><div class="co_hAlign1"><div class="co_indentTop05 co_indentBottom05">  V.
