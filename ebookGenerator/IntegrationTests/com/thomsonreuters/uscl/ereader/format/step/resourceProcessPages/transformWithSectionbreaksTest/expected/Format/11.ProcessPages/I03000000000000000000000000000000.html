        Most lawyers have infrequent contact with the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation (“Panel”). Indeed, most lawyers make it through their entire careers without encountering it. The reason for the relative obscurity of the Panel is its very limited role in handling most litigation matters. Its obscurity in the vast majority of cases, however, is far outweighed by its increasing importance in the efficient handling of certain cases pending in more than one federal district.

      <div class="co_paragraph"> 
       <div class="co_paragraphText">
        The Panel's relative obscurity contributes to the shock some lawyers feel upon their introduction to it. They have just filed an action in federal court (or had removed one to federal court) and have received a conditional transfer order transferring their case to a federal district court half-way across the country and to a judge known to demand a lot from lawyers. The sinking feeling that they have lost all control of their lawsuit is accompanied by the normal fear of the unknown.

        In reality the Panel is not a “supercourt” (nor is it a Star Chamber). Transfer is generally ordered to a district where all the pending actions can be managed in such a way to minimize the expense and delay for all litigants. It may permit litigation in a single, logical district even if that district would otherwise be unavailable due to venue or personal jurisdiction limitations. Transfer is also frequently denied, most often where meaningful alternatives to transfer exist. As is discussed throughout this book, but especially in Chapters 3 and 9, the Panel performs a minimal role in the cases other than to decide the transfer question. It is not thereafter involved in supervising the litigation in the transferee court.

        Although sometimes referred to as a “special” court, the Panel is not really a separate court.[

The judges are sitting federal circuit and district court judges assigned to courts created by statute.[

        Practice before the Panel is different in several important ways from practice before most federal courts. The Panel's function is fundamentally one of case management, not adjudication. The Panel holds oral arguments that are formal and similar in appearance to appellate court arguments, but the issues are very practical in nature and judicial precedent may play a minimal role in the Panel's decision process. The subject matter of the proceedings concerns how best to optimize the functioning of the federal judicial system for the benefit of all the litigants. The arguments are therefore very pragmatic and fact-oriented in tone. This combination of formal proceedings before a multi-judge panel and very practical focus of the proceedings is not commonly encountered elsewhere. A compendium of airline schedules may be a more important authority for the Panel in some cases than a Supreme Court decision.

      <div class="co_paragraph"> 
       <div class="co_paragraphText">
        The complexity of matters before the Panel also distinguishes hearings before it from other, judicial hearings. The Panel considers matters affecting scores or hundreds of cases in a single docket and may hear a dozen such dockets in a single morning. The Panel may easily hear and consider transfer of cases involving millions and millions of dollars. The Panel has also heard cases having minimal individual value. 
       </div> 
      </div> 
      <div class="co_paragraph"> 
       <div class="co_paragraphText">
        The practical nature of the Panel's task also reduces the importance of precedent. In many cases there is no precedent that dictates the Panel's<?pb label="5"?> decision; the Panel decides each matter of transfer on the unique facts of the cases before it. The decisions of the Panel are useful in establishing the factors the Panel considers in reaching the management decisions it makes. The Panel is composed of judges who routinely make their decisions based on the established precedent of the common law. The decisions of the Panel reflect the continuity of the common law, and for this reason the decisions are important to understanding the Panel's approach to the problems that come before it. Many of the Panel's decisions are designated by the Panel to be published. Those decisions that are published normally appear in the Federal Supplement, although a few opinions appear in Federal Rules Decisions. Some opinions are also printed in various topical and looseleaf services.

      <div class="co_paragraph"> 
       <div class="co_paragraphText">
        The Panel has considered motions for transfer in over 2,700 groups of cases affecting over 500,000 actions and claims. Many of the cases are similar or can be grouped into classes of cases. For example, the Panel has considered numerous cases arising from various airplane crashes. These cases are handled by the Panel in a consistent, though not mechanical, way.[
        <sup id="co_fnRef_I01a53a00680911e88f4a9c1f64101294_N10215"><a name="co_fnRef_I01a53a00680911e88f4a9c1f64101294_N10215" class="tr_ftn" ftnname="co_footnote_I01a53a00680911e88f4a9c1f64101294" href="#co_footnote_I01a53a00680911e88f4a9c1f64101294" page="5">4</a></sup>] The practices used by the Panel in earlier air-crash cases will certainly form the model for handling future similar cases. But the Panel may be expected to consider each case on its merits, and may develop new and innovative means of handling future crash cases. The changes that occur, however, can be expected to be evolutionary and will reflect the considered judgment of the best way of handling those cases in a manner likely to yield the greatest efficiency to the litigants and their counsel and minimize the burden the litigation places on the courts. In this way, the Panel's purpose of making the civil litigation system of the federal courts function the best for all the litigants, not only those involved in multidistrict cases, is realized.

        Procedure before the Panel is similar to that followed in any federal district court, i.e., the procedures of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure generally apply to Panel proceedings, although most of the rules have no relevance for Panel proceedings, as the Panel does not conduct trials, supervise discovery, consider dispositive motions, enter judgments, or do most of the myriad things the rules provide for. The Panel has, like all federal district courts, promulgated its own rules, which provide specifically for Panel proceedings.[

        Chapter 9 focuses on the nature of proceedings in the transferee court and the role of the Panel in those proceedings. That role is exceedingly limited. The transferee court is where the “magic” of the multidistrict venue statute takes place. Transferee courts have done a uniformly admirable job of managing difficult and extensive litigation without becoming overwhelmed. Transferee judges have been aptly referred to as the “unsung heroes” of multidistrict litigation.[

If litigation is not concluded in the transferee court, it is remanded to the district in which it was pending at the time of transfer by the Panel. Chapter 10 discusses remand by the Panel.
