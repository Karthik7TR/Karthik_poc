						<div class="co_paragraphText">A party filing electronically is required to serve courtesy copy on the Panel within 24 hours of filing. For non-ECF filers, this extra copy is filed simultaneously with the initial filing. The Rule explicitly forbids the delivery or mailing of papers to a single judge of the Panel. This Rule serves the general interest of requiring a single central location for filing documents. It is especially important for the Panel because the judges are normally located in various locations, each far from the Clerk's office, and it would place a significant and unnecessary burden on the judges of the Panel to have to receive filings and forward them to the Clerk and on the Clerk to monitor litigation with transnational filing. It also prevents what might be viewed as ex parte filing with a single Panel member, which could be viewed by a litigant as unfair. By operation of rule, it is improper.</div>

						<div class="co_paragraphText">If a party is required to provide paper copies to the Panel, either U.S. Mail or private courier (UPS, FedEx, etc.) may be used. In practice many of the Panel's submissions are received by each available method.</div>

						<div class="co_paragraphText">The procedure outlined above is the only method by which a party can invoke the statute to request transfer and consolidation or coordination of pretrial proceedings. A request for transfer that is not filed with the Panel will simply be ignored by the Panel and cannot be acted on by any other judge or court.
