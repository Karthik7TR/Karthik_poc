[CRC 3.1380(a)][12:501-503]&emsp;Reserved.a.&ensp;[12:504]&emsp;Compare&mdash;voluntary settlement conference (VSC):By local rules or policy, most superior courts allow the parties to request a settlement conference with a judge of their choosing at any time after suit is filed. There may be one, or several, such conferences&mdash;even after trial has commenced&mdash;and they are thus not technically a part of the trial setting process. Indeed, the procedural rules governing such voluntary settlement conferences often are quite distinct from those applicable to MSCs.b.&ensp;[12:505]&emsp;Compare&mdash;other court settlement procedures:In addition to MSCs and VSCs, some courts have created their own settlement programs, often with the services of volunteer lawyers.&bull;&ensp;[12:506]&emsp;For example, San Francisco Superior Court has an &ldquo;Early Settlement Conference Program&rdquo; as one of its ADR programs. Parties have the opportunity to engage in settlement discussions with a panel of volunteer attorneys experienced in the area of law involved (S.F. Sup.Ct. Rule 4.3). The court also offers a panel of experienced judges under its Judicial Mediation Program (www.sfsuperiorcourt.org/divisions/civil/dispute-resolution).&bull;&ensp;[12:507]&emsp;Several districts of the Los Angeles Superior Court&mdash;Central (Downtown L.A.), West (Santa Monica), Northwest (Van Nuys) and North Central (Glendale)&mdash;use volunteers from local bar associations for &ldquo;crash&rdquo; settlement programs to reduce backlogs.c.&ensp;[12:508]&emsp;Compare&mdash;mediation confidentiality requirements not applicable to MSCs:&emsp;Special confidentiality provisions that apply to mediations (see Ev.C. &sect;&sect;1115-1129) do not apply to mandatory settlement conferences. [See Adv. Comm. Notes to CRC 3.1380][12:509-510]&emsp;Reserved.2.&ensp;[12:511]&emsp;Which Judge:&emsp;In master calendar courts, MSCs may be assigned to any civil trial judge. (Most courts, however, will do their best to accommodate requests for a specific judge when both sides agree on a judge they want.)Some courts, like the Los Angeles Superior Court, may have dedicated &ldquo;settlement courts&rdquo; to handle mandatory settlement conferences, referred at the discretion of the &ldquo;direct calendar&rdquo; judges.In &ldquo;direct calendar&rdquo; courts, the judge assigned to hear the trial normally will not conduct the MSC unless all parties request the judge to do so. In some courts, however, the assigned judge will conduct the MSC unless a party objects. [See Orange Sup.Ct. Rule 316A&mdash;such objection to be filed with MSC statement (&para;12:516 ff.)]The court may appoint someone who is not a judge to conduct the settlement conference. However, someone presently serving as a mediator in the same action may not conduct a settlement conference. [CRC 3.1380(d)]&ensp;[12:511.1]&emsp;Practice pointer:&emsp;There is a risk in agreeing to have the assigned judge conduct the MSC, especially in nonjury cases. The judge may ask you to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of your case (usually without the other side being present), and those weaknesses may color the judge's perception of your client or your case when it comes to trial.Therefore, many lawyers refuse to stipulate to the assigned judge conducting the MSC unless they know the judge and feel confident he or she is able to disregard negative information disclosed during the MSC that is not part of the record at trial.Also, it is a good idea to obtain the client's approval (in writing) before stipulating to the trial judge conducting the MSC. Otherwise, if the case is lost, the client may claim the stipulation was malpractice and allowed the judge to &ldquo;prejudge&rdquo; the case.a.&ensp;[12:511.2]&emsp;Appointment of referee to conduct settlement conference:&emsp;The court clearly has the power to appoint a referee under CCP &sect;639 to conduct a mandatory settlement conference in a complex case. [See Adv. Comm. Comment to CRC 3.920]But whether the court has the power to order a party, over its objection, to pay any portion of the referee's fees and costs is less clear:&bull;&ensp;[12:511.3]&emsp;One case upheld a court order appointing a referee to conduct a mandatory settlement conference in a complex case that required the parties to pay the referee's fees and costs without their consent; but the court did not specifically address the compensation issue. [Lu v. Sup.Ct. (Grand Lincoln Village Homeowner Ass'n) (1997) 55 CA4th 1264, 1271-1272, 64 CR2d 561, 566] (Comment: This may be limited to complex cases.)&bull;&ensp;[12:511.4]&emsp;A later case holds the trial court may not order parties to attend and pay for private mediation without their consent because CRC 3.920(b) specifically forbids use of referees to conduct a mediation. [Jeld-Wen, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Marlborough Develop. Corp.) (2007) 146 CA4th 536, 542, 53 CR3d 115, 119]3.&ensp;[12:512]&emsp;Settlement Conference Statement Required:&emsp;When an MSC is ordered, each party must file and serve on the other, at least 5 court days before the MSC, a settlement conference statement. [CRC 3.1380(c)]&ldquo;MSC statements are formal documents filed with the court, and .&ensp;.&ensp;. counsel have a professional and ethical obligation to prepare them carefully and in good faith.&rdquo; [Robertson v. Chen (1996) 44 CA4th 1290, 1293, 52 CR2d 264, 266 (emphasis added)]&ensp;[12:513]&emsp;Practice pointer:&emsp;Even if not required under CRC 3.1380 or local rules, it is a good idea to prepare a settlement conference statement. These are the advantages:&bull;Taking the time to draft the statement will force you to sharpen your arguments and prepare you for the conference before the last minute.&bull;A formal statement will help the judge grasp your claims and contentions (much better than the pleadings can provide).&bull;In some courts, the contention statement is essential because the judges conducting settlement conferences do not receive the case file containing the pleadings.&bull;It will also impress your opponents (the ones you really need to convince) as to the strengths of your position and your readiness for trial.Without a settlement conference statement, the judge will be familiar only with the pleadings, which usually do not expose the detailed facts of the case. Valuable time then will be needed to pin down the disputed matters. And, due to limited time availability, this often necessitates a continuance of the MSC, meaning more attorney and court time. Thus, efforts spent in preparing a statement can prove highly cost-effective in avoiding unnecessary continuances.a.&ensp;[12:514]&emsp;Separate statement from each party:&emsp;A settlement conference statement is required from each party. [CRC 3.1380(c)] (The former rule required statements only from parties claiming damages.)(1)&ensp;[12:515]&emsp;Although not required by court rules, some judges require the parties to prepare and file a joint settlement conference statement.b.&ensp;[12:516]&emsp;Contents of statement:&emsp;A plaintiff's statement must itemize economic and noneconomic damages and contain a &ldquo;good faith settlement demand.&rdquo; [CRC 3.1380(c)]A defendant's statement must contain a &ldquo;good faith offer of settlement.&rdquo; [CRC 3.1380(c)]Each party's statement must discuss &ldquo;in detail&rdquo; the facts and law pertinent to the issues of liability and damages in the case. [CRC 3.1380(c)]It must also comply with any additional requirements under local court rules. [CRC 3.1380(c)]FORM:&emsp;Sample Plaintiff's Settlement Conference Statement (Personal Injury), see Form 12B:1 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).(1)&ensp;[12:517]&emsp;Not admissible in evidence:&emsp;An MSC statement is simply a statement of contentions. It cannot be used at trial&mdash;either to prove the opponent's case in chief or for impeachment purposes. [See Ev.C. &sect;1152&mdash;offers to compromise not admissible to prove liability; C &amp; K Engineering Contractors v. Amber Steel Co., Inc. (1978) 23 C3d 1, 13, 151 CR 323, 329&mdash;Ev.C. &sect;1152 exclusion broadly construed to include not only offers themselves, but also any statement made in course of settlement negotiations]Therefore, there is no danger in being candid. The MSC statement may, and should, focus on areas of weakness as well as strength in each party's case.&ensp;[12:517.1]&ensp; Practice pointers:&emsp;Use caution, however, where the trial judge conducts the MSC. Divulging weaknesses in your case may be risky (see &para;12:511.1).Also, bear in mind that even though the MSC statement is inadmissible, the facts disclosed in the statement may be subject to discovery if discovery is not yet completed. Thus, your statement could reveal to the opposing side other areas for discovery or provide an opportunity for your opponent to develop facts to lessen the impact of the evidence.&ensp;[12:518]&emsp;Further practice pointer&mdash;Treatment of &ldquo;smoking gun&rdquo; evidence:&emsp;Carefully consider whether and how to disclose &ldquo;smoking gun&rdquo; evidence (facts that will seriously impeach your opponent and of which the opponent is unaware):&bull;If you do not disclose such evidence to the MSC judge and opposing counsel, the MSC could be a waste of time and you probably will not obtain the most favorable settlement for your client. On the other hand, if you disclose crucial impeachment evidence at the MSC, opposing counsel may have time to obtain rebuttal evidence before the trial begins.&bull;Because most civil cases settle before trial, the chance of obtaining the best settlement for your client by disclosing the evidence at the MSC usually outweighs the risk of not disclosing it.&bull;There is less consensus on how to disclose it:&mdash;Some lawyers simply include the &ldquo;smoking gun&rdquo; evidence in the MSC statement served on opposing counsel.&mdash;For maximum impact, however, consider asking the judge to order the MSC statements lodged with the court and not served on opposing counsel, and mark the evidence &ldquo;CONFIDENTIAL&mdash;FOR JUDGE'S EYES ONLY.&rdquo; Also consider using this approach when alerting the judge to possible weaknesses in your position.&mdash;Alternatively, simply wait until your private in-chambers settlement discussions with the judge to disclose the evidence.&bull;In any event, the evidence is not likely to have much settlement impact until disclosed to opposing counsel. But it may be better to wait until you are satisfied that your opponent is truly motivated to settle the case before making the disclosure.c.&ensp;[12:519]&emsp;Service and &ldquo;submission&rdquo; of MSC statement:The MSC statement must be served on opposing counsel and &ldquo;submitted&rdquo; to the court at least 5 court days before the initial date set for the conference. [CRC 3.1380(c)]Some local rules provide that each party's statement is confidential and shall merely be lodged with the court, not served on opposing counsel; instead, plaintiff must serve a settlement demand and defendant must serve a response thereto before the conference (see &para;12:522 and Orange Sup.Ct. Rule 316B). (Comment: Such rules may be invalid as inconsistent with CRC 3.1380(c)&rsquo;s requirement that they be served on opposing counsel.)(1)&ensp;[12:520]&emsp;&ldquo;Submission&rdquo; vs. filing:&emsp;The MSC statement need only be &ldquo;submitted&rdquo; to the court. Do not file it. [See CRC 3.1380(c)]If you have submitted a confidential MSC statement &ldquo;for the judge's eyes only&rdquo; (see &para;12:518), make sure to ask that it be returned at the conclusion of the MSC.[12:521]&emsp;Reserved.(2)&ensp;[12:522]&emsp;Compare&mdash;local rules:&emsp;The 5-day limit imposed by CRC 3.1380(c) for service and &ldquo;submission&rdquo; is only a minimum. Local rules may require that the statements or demands be served earlier. [See Orange Sup.Ct. Rule 316F&mdash;P must serve settlement demand at least 5 days before hearing; D must serve response within 5 days after receipt and bring it to the hearing with proof of service attached][12:523-524]&emsp;Reserved.4.&ensp;Other Preparation for MSCa.&ensp;[12:525]&emsp;Pertinent documents:&emsp;The settlement judge (and opposing counsel) will expect you to be able to back up your contentions with pertinent documentary evidence. Thus, evidence of damages incurred (medical bills, repair or replacement bills, lost earnings or profits statements, etc.) and of liability (accident reports, pertinent photographs, deposition transcripts, etc.) should be organized and brought to the conference.&ensp;[12:525.1]&emsp;Practice pointer&mdash;For complex cases, prepare a time line:&emsp;In factually complex cases, providing a time line to the judge will help him or her obtain a quick understanding of the facts. Include in the time line as many undisputed events as possible; i.e., events memorialized by unobjectionable documentary evidence or uncontradicted deposition testimony.b.&ensp;[12:526]&emsp;Settlement authority:&emsp;An attorney has no right or power to settle without the client's specific consent. [Bice v. Stevens (1958) 160 CA2d 222, 231-232, 325 P2d 244, 250; Whittier Union High School Dist. v. Sup.Ct. (Carroll) (1977) 66 CA3d 504, 508, 136 CR 86, 89] Therefore, before the MSC, counsel should be sure to confer with their clients to establish settlement goals and authority.&ensp;[12:527]&emsp;Practice pointer&mdash;Obtain written authority:&emsp;The best precaution is to obtain written settlement authority from your client before agreeing to any settlement. Otherwise, it could be your word against the client's as to whether you were exceeding your authority to settle the case.If a settlement is reached during the MSC, have your client state on the record that he or she agrees to the settlement and be sure the record reflects that your client is fully informed as to the terms and effect of the settlement. Normally, opposing counsel and the settlement conference judge will also wish to have such a statement from your client on the record.If your client refuses to follow your settlement recommendations, it is a good idea to document those recommendations in a letter to the client. Such letter may cause the client to reconsider. Further, if the case goes to trial and the results do not meet your client's expectations, evidence of your earlier recommendations can serve as some protection against possible irate (malpractice) charges that the client might make against you.c.&ensp;[12:528]&emsp;Judge's expectations:&emsp;Even where local rule dictates MSC requirements and procedures, no two judges handle the conferences exactly the same way. Each invariably has his or her own peculiar practices and expectations. You will find yourself much more at ease at the conference, and the judge of greater assistance toward the ultimate settlement goal, if you are familiar with these preferences in advance.(1)&ensp;[12:529]&emsp;Consequently, before the MSC date arrives, contact the judge's clerk to check on any particular requirements that might affect the conduct of the conference.(2)&ensp;[12:530]&emsp;Also, contact other attorneys who have appeared before the same judge. They will not only have some insight on the judge's special preferences, but might also offer a valuable opinion on the judge's settlement reputation.5.&ensp;Who Must Attend MSCa.&ensp;[12:531]&emsp;Trial counsel:&emsp;The lawyer who is going to try the case must attend the MSC. [CRC 3.1380(b)] (In the past, some courts permitted appearances by &ldquo;any responsible lawyer familiar with the file and having authority to negotiate.&rdquo; However, this is no longer sufficient.)b.&ensp;[12:532]&emsp;Persons with settlement authority:&emsp;In addition to trial counsel, the parties and persons with authority to settle the case are required to attend the MSC. [CRC 3.1380(b); see Sigala v. Anaheim City School Dist. (1993) 15 CA4th 661, 670, 19 CR2d 38, 42&mdash;public entity's 15-member governing board ordered to attend; see also Orange Sup.Ct.

Rule 5.0(D)&mdash;parties and those with settlement authority required]Although the defendant's liability insurer is not a party to the action, the court's power to sanction the defendant generally assures appearance by a claims representative with authority to settle. Moreover, the court has power to impose monetary sanctions on an insurer (or any other person or entity) &ldquo;whose consent is necessary for the disposition of the case&rdquo; for failure to comply with the California Rules of Court. [CRC 2.30(b); see &para;9:1279](1)&ensp;[12:533]&emsp;Settlement not enforceable under CCP &sect;664.6 unless parties personally agree:&emsp;Neither a written settlement nor an oral settlement before the court is enforceable under CCP &sect;664.6 unless the parties personally agree to it.

See discussion at &para;12:959.c.&ensp;[12:535]&emsp;Others whose consent to settlement required:Other persons whose consent to settle is required &ldquo;for any reason&rdquo; must also be personally present. [CRC 3.1380(b)](1)&ensp;[12:536]&emsp;Professional persons insured for malpractice:&emsp;Many professional liability insurance (&ldquo;malpractice insurance&rdquo;) policies require the insurer to obtain the insured's consent to any settlement. In such cases, the insured must also be present at the MSC. [See CRC 3.1380(b)](2)&ensp;[12:537]&emsp;Compare&mdash;other insured defendants:&emsp;Other insured defendants may not be required to attend the MSC. As long as their insurance carrier is providing a defense and acknowledges coverage sufficient to cover plaintiff's claim, such defendants usually have nothing at stake and no voice in the settlement.But the rule is different, and the insured defendant's attendance is required, where:&bull;the policy requires the insurer to obtain the insured's consent to any settlement (&para;12:536); or&bull;the insured will be required to contribute a deductible to the settlement; or&bull;the insurance coverage is insufficient to cover plaintiff's claim (so that an excess judgment may be returned against the insured defendant personally); or&bull;the insurer has denied coverage or is defending on a &ldquo;reservation of rights&rdquo; basis (so that the insured defendant is potentially liable for the whole judgment).(3)&ensp;[12:538]&emsp;Lien claimants:&emsp;Persons, or entities, asserting a lien on plaintiff's claim (workers' compensation, Medi-Cal, other private insurance, etc.) must be present at the MSC.It is the responsibility of plaintiff's attorney to ascertain the existence of lien claimants and request that a representative with authority to settle be present at the MSC. Some courts permit the lien claimant's representative to be available by telephone instead of attending personally. [See L.A. Sup.Ct.

Each provider must attend if requested to do so by the court; if it fails to do so, it waives any right to reimbursement for benefits paid. [Gov.C. &sect;985(c)]d.&ensp;[12:541]&emsp;Attendance may be excused for &ldquo;good cause&rdquo;:On a showing of &ldquo;good cause&rdquo; (e.g., party residing out of state or country), the court may excuse any party's attendance at the MSC. [CRC 3.1380(b)]Such permission should be obtained in advance of the MSC. [Orange Sup.Ct. Rule 316G(5); see L.A. Sup.Ct. Rule 3.25(d)(2)]&ensp;[12:542]&emsp;Practice pointer:&emsp;Your chances of getting a party excused from attending in person are greatly enhanced if you can assure the court that the party will be available by telephone at the time of the conference.The court will usually condition its excuse on the party's agreeing to be so available.Even if the person with settlement authority is located in another time zone, he or she must remain available until the conference is over. Because some judges will work as long as it takes to achieve a settlement, make sure your settlement contact person will be available after normal office hours.If the case does not settle, the judge may order a further conference requiring the personal presence of all parties. See &para;12:552.6.&ensp;Role of Judge at MSCa.&ensp;[12:543]&emsp;Settlement judge as mediator:&emsp;The judge conducting the settlement conference typically uses the same techniques as those employed by mediators&mdash;i.e., facilitating &ldquo;communication between the disputants to assist them in reaching a mutually acceptable agreement.&rdquo; [Travelers Cas. &amp; Sur.

If the parties stipulate and agree to this procedure, the judge may render a binding decision then and there, without further notice or hearing. [See Mohn v. Kohlruss (1987) 196 CA3d 595, 598, 242 CR 110, 112]Some cases say that in such circumstances, the judge &ldquo;is not adjudicating an issue but is arbitrating a dispute.&rdquo; [See Mohn v. Kohlruss, supra, 196 CA3d at 598, 242 CR at 112&mdash;appellate review barred because judgment is entered by consent]More accurately, however, a sitting judge cannot be an arbitrator. A judge is a public officer and is bound to follow the law in matters submitted to him or her for decision. It makes no difference that the judge referred to himself or herself as an &ldquo;arbitrator.&rdquo; The proceedings before a judge are those of a bench trial subject to whatever waivers the parties have agreed upon (e.g., waiving a court reporter and the right to appeal).

In addition, meritless contentions in an MSC statement could result in sanctions under CCP &sect;128.7 for violating the implied certificate of legal and factual merit created upon presenting papers to the court (see &para;9:1135 ff.).b.&ensp;[12:549]&emsp;Types of sanctions:&emsp;Sanctions are limited to monetary sanctions plus reasonable expenses, including attorney fees, incurred in connection with the sanctions motion or the order to show cause.

More often, the judge will have the parties' agreement put on the record&mdash;i.e., the terms will be stated in open court, and taken down by a court reporter, or entered in the court minutes, or both.(The settlement is enforceable by the court regardless of whether it was &ldquo;put on the record&rdquo;; see CCP &sect;664.6, discussed at &para;12:950 ff.)a.&ensp;[12:566]&emsp;Purposes:&emsp;This serves several functions:&bull;It provides a record of exactly what was agreed upon;&bull;It assures that all settling parties actually heard and consented to the same thing at the same time; and&bull;It provides a basis for enforcement of the settlement, if necessary (see &para;12:950).b.&ensp;[12:567]&emsp;Procedure:&emsp;Settlements typically are put on the record as follows:&bull;The judge will take the bench and note the presence of the attorneys and parties.&bull;One of the attorneys then will be asked to state the terms of the settlement (usually the payment of a certain sum of money in exchange for a dismissal with prejudice, a release and a mutual waiver of costs).&bull;Opposing counsel and the parties then will be asked to confirm that the settlement as stated accurately embodies the agreement.&bull;The judge then may question the parties, asking whether they understand the settlement terms, whether they have any questions they would still like to ask their attorneys, whether they understand that the settlement puts an end to their claims and that they may not later reopen the case or sue again, and whether they accept the settlement as stated.(1)&ensp;[12:567.1]&emsp;Disposition of costs and fees:&emsp;A settlement agreement that is silent on the disposition of costs and attorney fees does not bar a postsettlement cost bill and/or motion for attorney fees (see &para;12:643). Therefore, unless one of the parties intends to seek costs and/or attorney fees, the record should include a statement explicitly providing that the parties waive costs and attorney fees. [Folsom v. Butte County Ass'n of Governments (1982) 32 C3d 668, 679, 186 CR 589, 597]&ensp;[12:568]&emsp;Practice pointer:&emsp;Consider using a recording device at the settlement conference for several reasons:Settlements sometimes are reached in the judge's chambers before or after court hours when no court reporter is available. The judge can dictate the settlement terms into your recorder and have it approved by all counsel and parties indicating their assent orally.Moreover, even if a court reporter is present and taking down the settlement terms, it is still advantageous to have your own recording. You don't have to pay for (or wait to obtain) a transcript from the reporter.However, make sure you have the judge's permission before you turn on the recorder. [See CRC 1.150(c), (d); Matter of Respondent X (Rev. Dept. 1997) 3 Cal. State Bar Ct.Rptr. 592]c.&ensp;[12:569]&emsp;Effect of supplemental written agreement:Occasionally, the settlement terms must be reduced to writing to clarify the parties' understanding. In such event, the judge will want it clearly stated whether the settlement is that now being presented verbally in court; or, whether the settlement is subject to signing of the written document still to be prepared.If a present settlement is intended, the case is disposed of with the parties' concurrence in court. The writing is treated simply as evidence of the earlier agreement.On the other hand, if the settlement is intended to take effect only on signing of the written agreement, there is no settlement until that time. [See, e.g., Mancina v. Hoar (1982) 129 CA3d 796, 801-802, 181 CR 347, 350] The attorneys and parties may thus be ordered to return at a later date for final settlement upon presentation of the executed written agreement.9.&ensp;[12:570]&emsp;Enforcing Settlement:&emsp;If either party fails to perform a settlement agreed to personally by the parties at the MSC, the court may order judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.

But they may be an effective strategy in business litigation and practically any other case where damages are sought. The consequences of rejecting such offers (see &para;12:647) put increasing pressure to settle on the opposing side as expert witness fees and other litigation costs rise.CCP &sect;998 offers may also be useful to defendants where attorney fees are awardable to the &ldquo;prevailing party&rdquo; under statute or contract. If plaintiff recovers less at trial than defendant's CCP &sect;998 pretrial offer, defendant may be regarded as the &ldquo;prevailing party&rdquo; and entitled to its postoffer fees (see &para;12:648.6 ff.).A judgment entered pursuant to &sect;998 also prevents findings of wrongful conduct by the defendant or other matters put in issue by the pleadings, and bars reopening the case to obtain such findings.On the other hand, defendants should consider that, if accepted, a &sect;998 offer may result in entry of a judgment against the defendant and that judgment may become public knowledge. Therefore, if defendant wants to keep the settlement confidential, a settlement agreement with a tightly worded confidentiality clause (see &para;12:1040 ff.) may be preferable to a &sect;998 offer.[12:592]&emsp;Compare&mdash;eminent domain proceedings:Different rules apply in eminent domain proceedings: Each side must file an offer at least 20 days before trial on issues relating to compensation; and those are the only offers the court can consider in determining entitlement to litigation expenses (including attorney fees and expert witness and appraiser fees).

Such correspondence may satisfy the &sect;998 requirements above (terms and conditions and provision for acceptance; &para;12:593). Therefore, counsel receiving a settlement proposal that satisfies the statute but that does not explicitly mention &sect;998 must ascertain whether it is intended as a &sect;998 offer (which, if not accepted, could expose the client to penalty costs).

The burden is on each counsel to determine at his or her peril whether the opposing party has in fact authorized the settlement. [Blanton v. Womancare, Inc., supra, 38 C3d at 406, 212 CR at 156]&ensp;[12:999]&emsp;Practice pointer:&emsp;To avoid any dispute with your own client re your authority to settle, have your client sign any settlement or other agreement compromising the client's &ldquo;substantive rights.&rdquo;And, insist upon the signature of the opposing party individually, in addition to opposing counsel's signature. Otherwise, you may be personally liable to your client for whatever damage results from your relying on an unauthorized stipulation by opposing counsel. (E.g., delays in getting to trial, costs of setting aside dismissals or judgment, etc.)If for some reason you and your client are willing to &ldquo;take a chance&rdquo; on counsel's signature alone, explain the risks to your client, obtain his or her authority to accept the signature, and then confirm that authority in writing.2.&ensp;[12:1000]&emsp;Duty to Communicate Settlement Offers to Client:An attorney is ethically obligated to advise his or her client of any material development in the case; and this includes settlement offers.

But to recover damages for breach of this duty, a client must prove breach of this duty. Thus, where lawyers are sued for having obtained less than the clients believe they should have received, the burden is on the client to prove that, &ldquo;but for&rdquo; the lawyers' negligence they would have obtained more.

On the other hand, the parties have the right to discuss settlement without their counsel present. But it is improper for either attorney to &ldquo;orchestrate&rdquo; the meeting or negotiations (e.g., by drafting documents). [See Cal. State Bar Form.Opn. 1993-131]However, improper communication with a party represented by counsel does not, by itself, invalidate a settlement agreement. [Myerchin v. Family Benefits, Inc.

Also, to ensure the privileged nature of the meeting, it is a good idea to confirm with opposing counsel that the meeting will occur and is intended solely for settlement purposes.6.&ensp;[12:1003]&emsp;Duty to Notify State Before Settling Claim Subject to State Lien:&emsp;Where plaintiff has received benefits from the State for injuries caused by a third party, the State may be entitled to a &ldquo;first lien&rdquo; on any settlement or recovery from the responsible party or its insurer, regardless of whether a lawsuit has been filed. For example:a.&ensp;[12:1004]&emsp;Medi-Cal benefits:&emsp;Where plaintiff has received Medi-Cal benefits, plaintiff's counsel must notify the State Director of Health Care Services of any legal proceedings against third parties and of any settlement, in sufficient time to allow the Director to perfect a lien for the benefits paid. [See Welf. &amp; Inst.C. &sect;&sect;14124.73(a), 14124.76, 14124.79]No settlement, judgment or award is final until the Director has an opportunity &ldquo;to perfect and to satisfy&rdquo; the Medi-Cal lien. [See Welf. &amp; Inst.C. &sect;14124.76(a)] The Director is allowed a lien of not more than the amount plaintiff recovers after deducting litigation expenses and attorney fees. [See Welf. &amp; Inst.C. &sect;&sect;14124.74, 14124.78]The lien amount, however, may not exceed the portion of the settlement or award representing payment for past medical services. [Welf. &amp; Inst.C. &sect;14124.76(a); see Arkansas Dept. of Health &amp; Human Services v. Ahlborn (2006) 547 US 268, 272-274, 126 S.Ct. 1752, 1757-1758; McMillian v.

Applicable regulations give CMS the right to seek reimbursement from a Medicare beneficiary or the beneficiary's attorney to the extent he or she received settlement payments from tortfeasors or insurers. [See 42 USC &sect;1395y(b)(2)(B); 42 CFR &sect;411.24(h)-(i)]Medicare's reimbursement right extends to defendants and their attorneys. If a defendant or its liability insurer pays a Medicare beneficiary's tort claim without satisfying a Medicare lien, it may end up paying twice. [42 CFR &sect;411.24(i)]Even more daunting, all parties in the case&mdash;plaintiff, defendant, defendant's insurer and attorneys on both sides&mdash;can be held liable for $1,000-a-day penalties for failure to comply with Medicare notification requirements; and double damages if the government sues to enforce its reimbursement rights. [42 USC &sect;1395y(b)(7)(B); 42 CFR &sect;411.24(c), (g)]&ensp;[12:1005.3]&emsp;Practice pointer:&emsp;To avoid potential personal liability, attorneys representing a Medicare beneficiary in a personal injury action should contact the CMS and propose conditional payment calculations before disbursing any settlement or award to plaintiff or other lienholders. (The CMS will probably be aware of the claim because defendants and their liability insurers are under a statutory duty to notify the CMS of the litigation; see 42 USC &sect;1395y(b)(7)(B).)Cross-refer: The subject of claims by Medicare beneficiaries is discussed further in Haning, Flahavan, Cheng &amp; Wright, Cal.

Any lump-sum offer by the opposing party creates a conflict in deciding how to allocate the funds between damages for the client and fees for the attorney. The same conflict may exist where damages and fees are negotiated separately; i.e., the opposing party may be willing to pay more in damages for the client if the attorney is willing to accept a smaller fee.

[See &ldquo;Discussion&rdquo; following CRPC 1-500(A)]&ensp;[12:1032]&emsp;Practice pointer:&emsp;Although plaintiff's lawyer may not agree not to represent other clients with claims against defendant, there is no bar to defendant hiring plaintiff's lawyer (e.g., to counsel defendant regarding future claims), thereby building in a conflict of interest that would disqualify that lawyer from representing other claimants.On the other hand, an agreement by the lawyer to be hired to do minimal work for a nominal fee could be construed as an impermissible promise not to represent other claimants.b.&ensp;[12:1033]&emsp;Promise not to disclose confidential information (&ldquo;secrecy clauses&rdquo;):&emsp;An attorney may also be asked to promise not to disclose the settlement terms and not to use or share information obtained through discovery or otherwise in the present litigation (e.g., not to disclose damaging evidence regarding the defendant's liability to other lawyers or news media).The validity of such clauses generally is discussed below (see &para;12:1040).To the extent such &ldquo;secrecy&rdquo; clauses limit the attorney's disclosure to other clients or future clients of the attorney, they probably violate CRPC 1-500(A) (&para;12:1031) because they indirectly restrict the attorney's right to practice law.

Except for the amount paid in settlement (see CCP &sect;2017.310(e)), a confidentiality provision is not enforceable unless:&mdash;the information is privileged; or&mdash;the information is not evidence of elder abuse; or&mdash;the party seeking to maintain confidentiality demonstrates a substantial probability of prejudice resulting from disclosure and that party's interests cannot be protected by redaction.

[CCP &sect;1002(a)]This prohibition, however, does not invalidate a defendant's agreement not to disclose medical information or personal identifying information (see Pen.C. &sect;530.55) regarding the victim of the felony sex offense or the nature of their relationship. [CCP &sect;1002(c)]A court may not enter an order restricting disclosure of information relating to these types of cases, and a provision in a settlement agreement entered into on or after January 1, 2017 that prevents disclosure of information related to the action is void as a matter of law and against public policy. [CCP &sect;1002(a)(4), (d)]In such cases, an attorney's demand that a confidentiality provision be included in the settlement agreement, or advising a client to sign an agreement that includes a confidentiality provision, may be grounds for discipline. [CCP &sect;1002(e)]b.&ensp;Application&bull;&ensp;[12:1042]&emsp;Customer's settlement agreement with Securities Salesperson prohibited Customer from disclosing Salesperson's misconduct to regulatory authorities. Salesperson could not recover from Customer for disclosing the facts in response to inquiries from regulatory authorities.

(E.g., &ldquo;Recognizing that actual damages may be difficult to establish, Settlor agrees to pay the sum of $50,000 as liquidated damages for any breach of this confidentiality agreement.&rdquo;)Comment: Such provisions often have an &ldquo;in terrorem effect&rdquo; regardless of the enforceability of the confidentiality clause.e.&ensp;[12:1048]&emsp;Confidentiality clause creating conflict of interest for attorney?&emsp;It is not clear whether a &ldquo;secrecy&rdquo; clause in a settlement agreement disqualifies an attorney from representing future clients where doing so would involve use of information covered by the &ldquo;secrecy&rdquo; clause:&bull;&ensp;[12:1048.1]&emsp;One view is that an attorney is disqualified because of the conflict created by the attorney's duty to represent a new client effectively (using whatever evidence is available) and the duty to avoid exposing the former client to liability for breach of the confidentiality provision. [See Gilbert v. National Corp. for Housing Partnerships (1999) 71 CA4th 1240, 1251, 84 CR2d 204, 211&mdash;attorney who had represented employees in discrimination action against employer was disqualified from representing another employee in a similar case against same employer because former clients were prospective witnesses and bound not to disclose settlement terms]&bull;&ensp;[12:1048.2]&emsp;But another case holds the attorney is not disqualified where the present and former clients properly waive any conflict of interest, and the only person objecting is the opposing party.

And before a court will sign a sealing order based on the parties' stipulation, it must find that:&mdash;an overriding interest supporting secrecy outweighs the right to public access;&mdash;a substantial probability exists that the overriding interest will be prejudiced if the records are not sealed;&mdash;the proposed sealing is narrowly tailored; and&mdash;no less restrictive means exist to achieve the overriding interest.

[CRC 3.1380(a)][12:501-503]&emsp;Reserved.a.&ensp;[12:504]&emsp;Compare&mdash;voluntary settlement conference (VSC):By local rules or policy, most superior courts allow the parties to request a settlement conference with a judge of their choosing at any time after suit is filed. There may be one, or several, such conferences&mdash;even after trial has commenced&mdash;and they are thus not technically a part of the trial setting process. Indeed, the procedural rules governing such voluntary settlement conferences often are quite distinct from those applicable to MSCs.b.&ensp;[12:505]&emsp;Compare&mdash;other court settlement procedures:In addition to MSCs and VSCs, some courts have created their own settlement programs, often with the services of volunteer lawyers.&bull;&ensp;[12:506]&emsp;For example, San Francisco Superior Court has an &ldquo;Early Settlement Conference Program&rdquo; as one of its ADR programs. Parties have the opportunity to engage in settlement discussions with a panel of volunteer attorneys experienced in the area of law involved (S.F. Sup.Ct. Rule 4.3). The court also offers a panel of experienced judges under its Judicial Mediation Program (www.sfsuperiorcourt.org/divisions/civil/dispute-resolution).&bull;&ensp;[12:507]&emsp;Several districts of the Los Angeles Superior Court&mdash;Central (Downtown L.A.), West (Santa Monica), Northwest (Van Nuys) and North Central (Glendale)&mdash;use volunteers from local bar associations for &ldquo;crash&rdquo; settlement programs to reduce backlogs.c.&ensp;[12:508]&emsp;Compare&mdash;mediation confidentiality requirements not applicable to MSCs:&emsp;Special confidentiality provisions that apply to mediations (see Ev.C. &sect;&sect;1115-1129) do not apply to mandatory settlement conferences. [See Adv. Comm. Notes to CRC 3.1380][12:509-510]&emsp;Reserved.2.&ensp;[12:511]&emsp;Which Judge:&emsp;In master calendar courts, MSCs may be assigned to any civil trial judge. (Most courts, however, will do their best to accommodate requests for a specific judge when both sides agree on a judge they want.)Some courts, like the Los Angeles Superior Court, may have dedicated &ldquo;settlement courts&rdquo; to handle mandatory settlement conferences, referred at the discretion of the &ldquo;direct calendar&rdquo; judges.In &ldquo;direct calendar&rdquo; courts, the judge assigned to hear the trial normally will not conduct the MSC unless all parties request the judge to do so. In some courts, however, the assigned judge will conduct the MSC unless a party objects. [See Orange Sup.Ct. Rule 316A&mdash;such objection to be filed with MSC statement (&para;12:516 ff.)]The court may appoint someone who is not a judge to conduct the settlement conference. However, someone presently serving as a mediator in the same action may not conduct a settlement conference. [CRC 3.1380(d)]&ensp;[12:511.1]&emsp;Practice pointer:&emsp;There is a risk in agreeing to have the assigned judge conduct the MSC, especially in nonjury cases. The judge may ask you to discuss the strengths and weaknesses of your case (usually without the other side being present), and those weaknesses may color the judge's perception of your client or your case when it comes to trial.Therefore, many lawyers refuse to stipulate to the assigned judge conducting the MSC unless they know the judge and feel confident he or she is able to disregard negative information disclosed during the MSC that is not part of the record at trial.Also, it is a good idea to obtain the client's approval (in writing) before stipulating to the trial judge conducting the MSC. Otherwise, if the case is lost, the client may claim the stipulation was malpractice and allowed the judge to &ldquo;prejudge&rdquo; the case.a.&ensp;[12:511.2]&emsp;Appointment of referee to conduct settlement conference:&emsp;The court clearly has the power to appoint a referee under CCP &sect;639 to conduct a mandatory settlement conference in a complex case. [See Adv. Comm. Comment to CRC 3.920]But whether the court has the power to order a party, over its objection, to pay any portion of the referee's fees and costs is less clear:&bull;&ensp;[12:511.3]&emsp;One case upheld a court order appointing a referee to conduct a mandatory settlement conference in a complex case that required the parties to pay the referee's fees and costs without their consent; but the court did not specifically address the compensation issue. [Lu v. Sup.Ct. (Grand Lincoln Village Homeowner Ass'n) (1997) 55 CA4th 1264, 1271-1272, 64 CR2d 561, 566] (Comment: This may be limited to complex cases.)&bull;&ensp;[12:511.4]&emsp;A later case holds the trial court may not order parties to attend and pay for private mediation without their consent because CRC 3.920(b) specifically forbids use of referees to conduct a mediation. [Jeld-Wen, Inc. v. Sup.Ct. (Marlborough Develop. Corp.) (2007) 146 CA4th 536, 542, 53 CR3d 115, 119]3.&ensp;[12:512]&emsp;Settlement Conference Statement Required:&emsp;When an MSC is ordered, each party must file and serve on the other, at least 5 court days before the MSC, a settlement conference statement. [CRC 3.1380(c)]&ldquo;MSC statements are formal documents filed with the court, and .&ensp;.&ensp;. counsel have a professional and ethical obligation to prepare them carefully and in good faith.&rdquo; [Robertson v. Chen (1996) 44 CA4th 1290, 1293, 52 CR2d 264, 266 (emphasis added)]&ensp;[12:513]&emsp;Practice pointer:&emsp;Even if not required under CRC 3.1380 or local rules, it is a good idea to prepare a settlement conference statement. These are the advantages:&bull;Taking the time to draft the statement will force you to sharpen your arguments and prepare you for the conference before the last minute.&bull;A formal statement will help the judge grasp your claims and contentions (much better than the pleadings can provide).&bull;In some courts, the contention statement is essential because the judges conducting settlement conferences do not receive the case file containing the pleadings.&bull;It will also impress your opponents (the ones you really need to convince) as to the strengths of your position and your readiness for trial.Without a settlement conference statement, the judge will be familiar only with the pleadings, which usually do not expose the detailed facts of the case. Valuable time then will be needed to pin down the disputed matters. And, due to limited time availability, this often necessitates a continuance of the MSC, meaning more attorney and court time. Thus, efforts spent in preparing a statement can prove highly cost-effective in avoiding unnecessary continuances.a.&ensp;[12:514]&emsp;Separate statement from each party:&emsp;A settlement conference statement is required from each party. [CRC 3.1380(c)] (The former rule required statements only from parties claiming damages.)(1)&ensp;[12:515]&emsp;Although not required by court rules, some judges require the parties to prepare and file a joint settlement conference statement.b.&ensp;[12:516]&emsp;Contents of statement:&emsp;A plaintiff's statement must itemize economic and noneconomic damages and contain a &ldquo;good faith settlement demand.&rdquo; [CRC 3.1380(c)]A defendant's statement must contain a &ldquo;good faith offer of settlement.&rdquo; [CRC 3.1380(c)]Each party's statement must discuss &ldquo;in detail&rdquo; the facts and law pertinent to the issues of liability and damages in the case. [CRC 3.1380(c)]It must also comply with any additional requirements under local court rules. [CRC 3.1380(c)]FORM:&emsp;Sample Plaintiff's Settlement Conference Statement (Personal Injury), see Form 12B:1 in Rivera, Cal. Prac. Guide: Civ. Pro. Before Trial FORMS (TRG).(1)&ensp;[12:517]&emsp;Not admissible in evidence:&emsp;An MSC statement is simply a statement of contentions. It cannot be used at trial&mdash;either to prove the opponent's case in chief or for impeachment purposes. [See Ev.C. &sect;1152&mdash;offers to compromise not admissible to prove liability; C &amp; K Engineering Contractors v. Amber Steel Co., Inc. (1978) 23 C3d 1, 13, 151 CR 323, 329&mdash;Ev.C. &sect;1152 exclusion broadly construed to include not only offers themselves, but also any statement made in course of settlement negotiations]Therefore, there is no danger in being candid. The MSC statement may, and should, focus on areas of weakness as well as strength in each party's case.&ensp;[12:517.1]&ensp; Practice pointers:&emsp;Use caution, however, where the trial judge conducts the MSC. Divulging weaknesses in your case may be risky (see &para;12:511.1).Also, bear in mind that even though the MSC statement is inadmissible, the facts disclosed in the statement may be subject to discovery if discovery is not yet completed. Thus, your statement could reveal to the opposing side other areas for discovery or provide an opportunity for your opponent to develop facts to lessen the impact of the evidence.&ensp;[12:518]&emsp;Further practice pointer&mdash;Treatment of &ldquo;smoking gun&rdquo; evidence:&emsp;Carefully consider whether and how to disclose &ldquo;smoking gun&rdquo; evidence (facts that will seriously impeach your opponent and of which the opponent is unaware):&bull;If you do not disclose such evidence to the MSC judge and opposing counsel, the MSC could be a waste of time and you probably will not obtain the most favorable settlement for your client. On the other hand, if you disclose crucial impeachment evidence at the MSC, opposing counsel may have time to obtain rebuttal evidence before the trial begins.&bull;Because most civil cases settle before trial, the chance of obtaining the best settlement for your client by disclosing the evidence at the MSC usually outweighs the risk of not disclosing it.&bull;There is less consensus on how to disclose it:&mdash;Some lawyers simply include the &ldquo;smoking gun&rdquo; evidence in the MSC statement served on opposing counsel.&mdash;For maximum impact, however, consider asking the judge to order the MSC statements lodged with the court and not served on opposing counsel, and mark the evidence &ldquo;CONFIDENTIAL&mdash;FOR JUDGE'S EYES ONLY.&rdquo; Also consider using this approach when alerting the judge to possible weaknesses in your position.&mdash;Alternatively, simply wait until your private in-chambers settlement discussions with the judge to disclose the evidence.&bull;In any event, the evidence is not likely to have much settlement impact until disclosed to opposing counsel. But it may be better to wait until you are satisfied that your opponent is truly motivated to settle the case before making the disclosure.c.&ensp;[12:519]&emsp;Service and &ldquo;submission&rdquo; of MSC statement:The MSC statement must be served on opposing counsel and &ldquo;submitted&rdquo; to the court at least 5 court days before the initial date set for the conference. [CRC 3.1380(c)]Some local rules provide that each party's statement is confidential and shall merely be lodged with the court, not served on opposing counsel; instead, plaintiff must serve a settlement demand and defendant must serve a response thereto before the conference (see &para;12:522 and Orange Sup.Ct. Rule 316B). (Comment: Such rules may be invalid as inconsistent with CRC 3.1380(c)&rsquo;s requirement that they be served on opposing counsel.)(1)&ensp;[12:520]&emsp;&ldquo;Submission&rdquo; vs. filing:&emsp;The MSC statement need only be &ldquo;submitted&rdquo; to the court. Do not file it. [See CRC 3.1380(c)]If you have submitted a confidential MSC statement &ldquo;for the judge's eyes only&rdquo; (see &para;12:518), make sure to ask that it be returned at the conclusion of the MSC.[12:521]&emsp;Reserved.(2)&ensp;[12:522]&emsp;Compare&mdash;local rules:&emsp;The 5-day limit imposed by CRC 3.1380(c) for service and &ldquo;submission&rdquo; is only a minimum. Local rules may require that the statements or demands be served earlier. [See Orange Sup.Ct. Rule 316F&mdash;P must serve settlement demand at least 5 days before hearing; D must serve response within 5 days after receipt and bring it to the hearing with proof of service attached][12:523-524]&emsp;Reserved.4.&ensp;Other Preparation for MSCa.&ensp;[12:525]&emsp;Pertinent documents:&emsp;The settlement judge (and opposing counsel) will expect you to be able to back up your contentions with pertinent documentary evidence. Thus, evidence of damages incurred (medical bills, repair or replacement bills, lost earnings or profits statements, etc.) and of liability (accident reports, pertinent photographs, deposition transcripts, etc.) should be organized and brought to the conference.&ensp;[12:525.1]&emsp;Practice pointer&mdash;For complex cases, prepare a time line:&emsp;In factually complex cases, providing a time line to the judge will help him or her obtain a quick understanding of the facts. Include in the time line as many undisputed events as possible; i.e., events memorialized by unobjectionable documentary evidence or uncontradicted deposition testimony.b.&ensp;[12:526]&emsp;Settlement authority:&emsp;An attorney has no right or power to settle without the client's specific consent. [Bice v. Stevens (1958) 160 CA2d 222, 231-232, 325 P2d 244, 250; Whittier Union High School Dist. v. Sup.Ct. (Carroll) (1977) 66 CA3d 504, 508, 136 CR 86, 89] Therefore, before the MSC, counsel should be sure to confer with their clients to establish settlement goals and authority.&ensp;[12:527]&emsp;Practice pointer&mdash;Obtain written authority:&emsp;The best precaution is to obtain written settlement authority from your client before agreeing to any settlement. Otherwise, it could be your word against the client's as to whether you were exceeding your authority to settle the case.If a settlement is reached during the MSC, have your client state on the record that he or she agrees to the settlement and be sure the record reflects that your client is fully informed as to the terms and effect of the settlement. Normally, opposing counsel and the settlement conference judge will also wish to have such a statement from your client on the record.If your client refuses to follow your settlement recommendations, it is a good idea to document those recommendations in a letter to the client. Such letter may cause the client to reconsider. Further, if the case goes to trial and the results do not meet your client's expectations, evidence of your earlier recommendations can serve as some protection against possible irate (malpractice) charges that the client might make against you.c.&ensp;[12:528]&emsp;Judge's expectations:&emsp;Even where local rule dictates MSC requirements and procedures, no two judges handle the conferences exactly the same way. Each invariably has his or her own peculiar practices and expectations. You will find yourself much more at ease at the conference, and the judge of greater assistance toward the ultimate settlement goal, if you are familiar with these preferences in advance.(1)&ensp;[12:529]&emsp;Consequently, before the MSC date arrives, contact the judge's clerk to check on any particular requirements that might affect the conduct of the conference.(2)&ensp;[12:530]&emsp;Also, contact other attorneys who have appeared before the same judge. They will not only have some insight on the judge's special preferences, but might also offer a valuable opinion on the judge's settlement reputation.5.&ensp;Who Must Attend MSCa.&ensp;[12:531]&emsp;Trial counsel:&emsp;The lawyer who is going to try the case must attend the MSC. [CRC 3.1380(b)] (In the past, some courts permitted appearances by &ldquo;any responsible lawyer familiar with the file and having authority to negotiate.&rdquo; However, this is no longer sufficient.)b.&ensp;[12:532]&emsp;Persons with settlement authority:&emsp;In addition to trial counsel, the parties and persons with authority to settle the case are required to attend the MSC. [CRC 3.1380(b); see Sigala v. Anaheim City School Dist. (1993) 15 CA4th 661, 670, 19 CR2d 38, 42&mdash;public entity's 15-member governing board ordered to attend; see also Orange Sup.Ct. Rule 316F&mdash;attorneys must be prepared to present written evidence of having notified clients and insurance carriers of their duty to attend; S.F. Sup.Ct. Rule 5.0(D)&mdash;parties and those with settlement authority required]Although the defendant's liability insurer is not a party to the action, the court's power to sanction the defendant generally assures appearance by a claims representative with authority to settle. Moreover, the court has power to impose monetary sanctions on an insurer (or any other person or entity) &ldquo;whose consent is necessary for the disposition of the case&rdquo; for failure to comply with the California Rules of Court. [CRC 2.30(b); see &para;9:1279](1)&ensp;[12:533]&emsp;Settlement not enforceable under CCP &sect;664.6 unless parties personally agree:&emsp;Neither a written settlement nor an oral settlement before the court is enforceable under CCP &sect;664.6 unless the parties personally agree to it. See detailed discussion at &para;12:956.(a)&ensp;[12:534]&ensp; Insurer's power to settle excusing insured's presence?&emsp;Where liability insurance coverage limits are adequate and the insurer is defending without a reservation of rights, the insurer's power to control settlement may eliminate the need for the insured defendant to participate personally in the settlement process. See discussion at &para;12:959.c.&ensp;[12:535]&emsp;Others whose consent to settlement required:Other persons whose consent to settle is required &ldquo;for any reason&rdquo; must also be personally present. [CRC 3.1380(b)](1)&ensp;[12:536]&emsp;Professional persons insured for malpractice:&emsp;Many professional liability insurance (&ldquo;malpractice insurance&rdquo;) policies require the insurer to obtain the insured's consent to any settlement. In such cases, the insured must also be present at the MSC. [See CRC 3.1380(b)](2)&ensp;[12:537]&emsp;Compare&mdash;other insured defendants:&emsp;Other insured defendants may not be required to attend the MSC. As long as their insurance carrier is providing a defense and acknowledges coverage sufficient to cover plaintiff's claim, such defendants usually have nothing at stake and no voice in the settlement.But the rule is different, and the insured defendant's attendance is required, where:&bull;the policy requires the insurer to obtain the insured's consent to any settlement (&para;12:536); or&bull;the insured will be required to contribute a deductible to the settlement; or&bull;the insurance coverage is insufficient to cover plaintiff's claim (so that an excess judgment may be returned against the insured defendant personally); or&bull;the insurer has denied coverage or is defending on a &ldquo;reservation of rights&rdquo; basis (so that the insured defendant is potentially liable for the whole judgment).(3)&ensp;[12:538]&emsp;Lien claimants:&emsp;Persons, or entities, asserting a lien on plaintiff's claim (workers' compensation, Medi-Cal, other private insurance, etc.) must be present at the MSC.It is the responsibility of plaintiff's attorney to ascertain the existence of lien claimants and request that a representative with authority to settle be present at the MSC. Some courts permit the lien claimant's representative to be available by telephone instead of attending personally. [See L.A. Sup.Ct. Rule 3.25(d)(4)][12:539]&emsp;Reserved.(4)&ensp;[12:540]&emsp;&ldquo;Collateral source&rdquo; providers in tort actions against governmental entity:&emsp;A governmental entity's liability for personal injury or wrongful death to plaintiff may be reduced to reflect &ldquo;collateral source&rdquo; payments received by the plaintiff (see Gov.C. &sect;985).The defendant governmental entity must give &ldquo;collateral source&rdquo; providers identified by plaintiff written notice of any settlement conferences. Each provider must attend if requested to do so by the court; if it fails to do so, it waives any right to reimbursement for benefits paid. [Gov.C. &sect;985(c)]d.&ensp;[12:541]&emsp;Attendance may be excused for &ldquo;good cause&rdquo;:On a showing of &ldquo;good cause&rdquo; (e.g., party residing out of state or country), the court may excuse any party's attendance at the MSC. [CRC 3.1380(b)]Such permission should be obtained in advance of the MSC. [Orange Sup.Ct. Rule 316G(5); see L.A. Sup.Ct. Rule 3.25(d)(2)]&ensp;[12:542]&emsp;Practice pointer:&emsp;Your chances of getting a party excused from attending in person are greatly enhanced if you can assure the court that the party will be available by telephone at the time of the conference.The court will usually condition its excuse on the party's agreeing to be so available.Even if the person with settlement authority is located in another time zone, he or she must remain available until the conference is over. Because some judges will work as long as it takes to achieve a settlement, make sure your settlement contact person will be available after normal office hours.If the case does not settle, the judge may order a further conference requiring the personal presence of all parties. See &para;12:552.6.&ensp;Role of Judge at MSCa.&ensp;[12:543]&emsp;Settlement judge as mediator:&emsp;The judge conducting the settlement conference typically uses the same techniques as those employed by mediators&mdash;i.e., facilitating &ldquo;communication between the disputants to assist them in reaching a mutually acceptable agreement.&rdquo; [Travelers Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Sup.Ct. (Clergy Cases) (2005) 126 CA4th 1131, 1138, 24 CR3d 751, 757 (internal quotes omitted)]A settlement judge has no authority to make factual findings or to issue coercive orders. [Travelers Cas. &amp; Sur. Co. v. Sup.Ct. (Clergy Cases), supra, 126 CA4th at 1141-1142, 24 CR3d at 759-760&mdash;improper for court to issue &ldquo;valuation order&rdquo; purporting to establish good faith settlement value of claims]b.&ensp;[12:544]&emsp;Settlement judge as &ldquo;arbitrator&rdquo;?&emsp;There is no reason, however, why a settlement judge cannot also be called upon to decide particular issues that may be preventing settlement (e.g., whether a party is entitled to a certain credit or offset). If the parties stipulate and agree to this procedure, the judge may render a binding decision then and there, without further notice or hearing. [See Mohn v. Kohlruss (1987) 196 CA3d 595, 598, 242 CR 110, 112]Some cases say that in such circumstances, the judge &ldquo;is not adjudicating an issue but is arbitrating a dispute.&rdquo; [See Mohn v.

More often, the judge will have the parties' agreement put on the record&mdash;i.e., the terms will be stated in open court, and taken down by a court reporter, or entered in the court minutes, or both.(The settlement is enforceable by the court regardless of whether it was &ldquo;put on the record&rdquo;; see CCP &sect;664.6, discussed at &para;12:950 ff.)a.&ensp;[12:566]&emsp;Purposes:&emsp;This serves several functions:&bull;It provides a record of exactly what was agreed upon;&bull;It assures that all settling parties actually heard and consented to the same thing at the same time; and&bull;It provides a basis for enforcement of the settlement, if necessary (see &para;12:950).b.&ensp;[12:567]&emsp;Procedure:&emsp;Settlements typically are put on the record as follows:&bull;The judge will take the bench and note the presence of the attorneys and parties.&bull;One of the attorneys then will be asked to state the terms of the settlement (usually the payment of a certain sum of money in exchange for a dismissal with prejudice, a release and a mutual waiver of costs).&bull;Opposing counsel and the parties then will be asked to confirm that the settlement as stated accurately embodies the agreement.&bull;The judge then may question the parties, asking whether they understand the settlement terms, whether they have any questions they would still like to ask their attorneys, whether they understand that the settlement puts an end to their claims and that they may not later reopen the case or sue again, and whether they accept the settlement as stated.(1)&ensp;[12:567.1]&emsp;Disposition of costs and fees:&emsp;A settlement agreement that is silent on the disposition of costs and attorney fees does not bar a postsettlement cost bill and/or motion for attorney fees (see &para;12:643). Therefore, unless one of the parties intends to seek costs and/or attorney fees, the record should include a statement explicitly providing that the parties waive costs and attorney fees. [Folsom v.

The judge can dictate the settlement terms into your recorder and have it approved by all counsel and parties indicating their assent orally.Moreover, even if a court reporter is present and taking down the settlement terms, it is still advantageous to have your own recording. You don't have to pay for (or wait to obtain) a transcript from the reporter.However, make sure you have the judge's permission before you turn on the recorder.

State Bar Ct.Rptr. 592]c.&ensp;[12:569]&emsp;Effect of supplemental written agreement:Occasionally, the settlement terms must be reduced to writing to clarify the parties' understanding. In such event, the judge will want it clearly stated whether the settlement is that now being presented verbally in court; or, whether the settlement is subject to signing of the written document still to be prepared.If a present settlement is intended, the case is disposed of with the parties' concurrence in court. The writing is treated simply as evidence of the earlier agreement.On the other hand, if the settlement is intended to take effect only on signing of the written agreement, there is no settlement until that time. [See, e.g., Mancina v. Hoar (1982) 129 CA3d 796, 801-802, 181 CR 347, 350] The attorneys and parties may thus be ordered to return at a later date for final settlement upon presentation of the executed written agreement.9.&ensp;[12:570]&emsp;Enforcing Settlement:&emsp;If either party fails to perform a settlement agreed to personally by the parties at the MSC, the court may order judgment pursuant to the terms of the settlement.

[CCP &sect;998(b)(2)] (An unaccepted offer may not be filed with the court; see CRC 3.250(a)(23).)&ensp;[12:591]&emsp;Practice pointers:&emsp;CCP &sect;998 offers are common in personal injury cases. But they may be an effective strategy in business litigation and practically any other case where damages are sought. The consequences of rejecting such offers (see &para;12:647) put increasing pressure to settle on the opposing side as expert witness fees and other litigation costs rise.CCP &sect;998 offers may also be useful to defendants where attorney fees are awardable to the &ldquo;prevailing party&rdquo; under statute or contract. If plaintiff recovers less at trial than defendant's CCP &sect;998 pretrial offer, defendant may be regarded as the &ldquo;prevailing party&rdquo; and entitled to its postoffer fees (see &para;12:648.6 ff.).A judgment entered pursuant to &sect;998 also prevents findings of wrongful conduct by the defendant or other matters put in issue by the pleadings, and bars reopening the case to obtain such findings.On the other hand, defendants should consider that, if accepted, a &sect;998 offer may result in entry of a judgment against the defendant and that judgment may become public knowledge. Therefore, if defendant wants to keep the settlement confidential, a settlement agreement with a tightly worded confidentiality clause (see &para;12:1040 ff.) may be preferable to a &sect;998 offer.[12:592]&emsp;Compare&mdash;eminent domain proceedings:Different rules apply in eminent domain proceedings: Each side must file an offer at least 20 days before trial on issues relating to compensation; and those are the only offers the court can consider in determining entitlement to litigation expenses (including attorney fees and expert witness and appraiser fees).

But it must harmonize the public policy favoring settlements with the competing public policy favoring equitable sharing of costs among tortfeasors. To accomplish this, the settlement must be within the &ldquo;reasonable range&rdquo; (within the &ldquo;ballpark&rdquo;) of the settling tortfeasor's share of liability for the plaintiff's injuries&mdash;taking into consideration the facts and circumstances of the particular case. [Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde &amp; Assocs. (1985) 38 C3d 488, 499, 213 CR 256, 263]Thus, even a settlement that seems disproportionately low may be justified by showing that damages or liability are speculative; or that the settling defendant had no insurance or was underinsured or insolvent. [Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde &amp; Assocs., supra, 38 C3d at 499, 213 CR at 263]&ldquo;Good faith&rdquo; depends upon what the plaintiffs knew about liability at the time of settlement, not evidence that might be acquired later.

[Tech-Bilt, Inc. v. Woodward-Clyde &amp; Assocs., supra, 38 C3d at 499, 213 CR at 263-264]Another key factor is the settling tortfeasor's potential liability for indemnity to joint tortfeasors.

[See Civ.C. &sect;&sect;1431.1-1431.5, commonly known as &ldquo;Prop. 51&rdquo;]This does away with the common law rule of joint and several tort liability, under which a defendant who bore only a small share of fault could be forced to pay all or a large share of plaintiff's damages if more culpable tortfeasors were insolvent. [See Buttram v. Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corp. (1997) 16 C4th 520, 528, 66 CR2d 438, 442]Prop. 51 thus adds another factor affecting determination of the &ldquo;good faith&rdquo; of piecemeal settlements: The gross amount of any settlement in an action subject to Prop. 51 must be within the &ldquo;reasonable range ballpark&rdquo; of the settling defendant's liability for:&mdash;100% of the economic damages suffered by plaintiff; and&mdash;the approximate share of noneconomic damages for which the settling defendant is personally at fault.

Any recoveries obtained from them apply against the amount which the settling tortfeasor must pay. (The agreement is often coupled with provisions for interim, unsecured &ldquo;loans&rdquo; from the settling tortfeasor to plaintiff, pending conclusion of the lawsuit against the other defendants.) [See CCP &sect;877.5(b)](2)&ensp;[12:812]&emsp;Example:&emsp;D1 agrees to pay P $3,000,000, upon settlement or judgment of P's claims against D2 and D3, less whatever amount P recovers from those defendants.

And, depending upon the agreement, D1 may even be entitled to refund of moneys &ldquo;loaned&rdquo; to P.The fact D1 is not obligated to pay any certain amount does not mean the agreement has no value. It is akin to insurance. Its value must be determined at the &ldquo;good faith&rdquo; hearing (see &para;12:816 ff.).(b)&ensp;[12:814]&ensp; Comment:&emsp;This type of settlement is susceptible to abuse. The most culpable defendants may get credit for settlements paid by less-culpable tortfeasors, and thus escape their fair share of liability. This does not necessarily render them invalid, however.

It will be extremely difficult to draft language satisfying this requirement.However, settlors may accomplish the same result by spelling out in advance the effect of subsequent settlements on their guarantee. (Example: D1 guarantees $1,000,000 less the amount of any recovery from D2 in excess of $250,000. If the recovery from D2 is between $100,000 and $250,000, D1's guarantee is reduced to $750,000; if the recovery is under $100,000, the guarantee is reduced to $500,000; etc.)And, there may be circumstances in which parties other than the settling defendant may be allowed a veto power over later settlements.

[CCP &sect;664.6]The parties need not agree in the same manner; i.e., some parties may stipulate to the settlement in open court while others stipulate in writing. [Elyaoudayan v. Hoffman (2003) 104 CA4th 1421, 1429, 129 CR2d 41, 46]If requested by the parties, the court may retain jurisdiction over the parties to enforce the settlement until performance in full of the settlement terms.

The plaintiff should seek to amend the complaint to add a breach of contract claim, and then move for summary judgment. Of course, if the settlement's enforceability turns on a factual dispute (e.g., mistake, fraud, etc.), summary judgment will be denied and the matter will have to be resolved at trial.b.&ensp;[12:953]&emsp;Writing signed by parties:&emsp;The statute states any written settlement agreement outside of court must be signed by the parties. [CCP &sect;664.6; see discussion at &para;12:956 ff.]This is interpreted to mean that the settlement must be signed by both the party seeking to enforce the agreement under &sect;664.6 and the party against whom it is to be enforced.

But it is improper for either attorney to &ldquo;orchestrate&rdquo; the meeting or negotiations (e.g., by drafting documents). [See Cal.

Also, to ensure the privileged nature of the meeting, it is a good idea to confirm with opposing counsel that the meeting will occur and is intended solely for settlement purposes.6.&ensp;[12:1003]&emsp;Duty to Notify State Before Settling Claim Subject to State Lien:&emsp;Where plaintiff has received benefits from the State for injuries caused by a third party, the State may be entitled to a &ldquo;first lien&rdquo; on any settlement or recovery from the responsible party or its insurer, regardless of whether a lawsuit has been filed. For example:a.&ensp;[12:1004]&emsp;Medi-Cal benefits:&emsp;Where plaintiff has received Medi-Cal benefits, plaintiff's counsel must notify the State Director of Health Care Services of any legal proceedings against third parties and of any settlement, in sufficient time to allow the Director to perfect a lien for the benefits paid.

Any lump-sum offer by the opposing party creates a conflict in deciding how to allocate the funds between damages for the client and fees for the attorney. The same conflict may exist where damages and fees are negotiated separately; i.e., the opposing party may be willing to pay more in damages for the client if the attorney is willing to accept a smaller fee.
