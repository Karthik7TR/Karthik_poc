                    <paratext>Most lawyers have infrequent contact with the Judicial Panel on Multidistrict Litigation
                        (“Panel”).
                        <eos/>
                        <bos/>
                        Indeed, most lawyers make it through their entire careers without encountering it.
                        <eos/>
                        <bos/>The reason for the relative obscurity of the Panel is its very limited role in handling
                        most litigation matters.
                        <eos/>
                        <bos/>Its obscurity in the vast majority of cases, however, is far outweighed by its increasing
                        importance in the efficient handling of certain cases pending in more than one federal district.

                    <paratext>The Panel&apos;s relative obscurity contributes to the shock some lawyers feel upon their
                        introduction to it.
                        <eos/>
                        <bos/>They have just filed an action in federal court (or had removed one to federal court) and
                        have received a conditional transfer order transferring their case to a federal district court
                        half-way across the country and to a judge known to demand a lot from lawyers.
                        <eos/>
                        <bos/>The sinking feeling that they have lost all control of their lawsuit is accompanied by the
                        normal fear of the unknown.

                    <paratext>In reality the Panel is not a “supercourt” (nor is it a Star Chamber).

                        <bos/>
                        Transfer is generally ordered to a district where all the pending actions can be managed in such
                        a way to minimize the expense and delay for all litigants.
                        <eos/>
                        <bos/>It may permit litigation in a single, logical district even if that district would
                        otherwise be unavailable due to venue or personal jurisdiction limitations.
                        <eos/>
                        <bos/>Transfer is also frequently denied, most often where meaningful alternatives to transfer
                        exist.
                        <eos/>
                        <bos/>As is discussed throughout this book, but especially in Chapters 3 and 9, the Panel
                        performs a minimal role in the cases other than to decide the transfer question.
                        <eos/>
                        <bos/>It is not thereafter involved in supervising the litigation in the transferee court.
