water contamination at Walkerton, Ontario, caused seven deaths and over 2,300 people to become ill. <eos/><bos/>Betty Trushinski, aged 56, was one of the people who died as a result of the outbreak. <eos/><bos/>Betty&apos;s daughter expressed her feelings of deep loss:</paratext><display.quote><para><paratext><begin.quote ID="QT_0001"/>She died in the hospital away from her home, hooked up to machines and tubes in a coma. <eos/><bos/>She suffered terribly for ten days. <eos/><bos/>She never had a chance to understand her illness. <eos/><bos/>She couldn&apos;t put her affairs in order or say goodbye. <eos/><bos/>There was no time. <eos/><bos/>She just got sicker and sicker … and we were always ten steps behind the illness. <eos/><bos/>Her dreams of her retirement with Dad and traveling were stolen, all because the water was unsafe and nobody told her.<eos/><bos/><end.quote refid="QT_0001"/>[<footnote.reference

<eos/><bos/>The facts at Walkerton, which came to light as a result of the subsequent inquiry, led to a serious outcry because some of the illnesses, and perhaps even some of the deaths, could have been prevented.[<eos/><bos/><footnote.reference refid="I108abad1af1611ea903cf5d4be638fe0">2</footnote.reference>] Beyond the boundaries of Walkerton, the tragedy touched a raw nerve. <eos/><bos/>The hidden danger in doing something as commonplace as drinking water, left many people feeling powerless and with a sense of dread.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>In North American society in the 21st century, we assume that government can provide competent basic services and effectively regulate those who provide such services for profit. <eos/><bos/>Yet not all risks are, or can be, regulated by statutes that provide penalties for non-compliance. <eos/><bos/>To calculate what should be regulated and to what degree, it is essential to have a working knowledge of the principles of risk assessment and risk management. <eos/><bos/>O&apos;Connor J.A. emphasized the importance of risk management at Walkerton:</paratext><display.quote><para><paratext><begin.quote ID="QT_0002"/>Despite having knowledge that there could be risks, no member of Cabinet or other public servant directed that a risk assessment and management plan be conducted to determine the extent of those risks, whether the risks should be assumed, and if assumed, whether they could be managed. <eos/><bos/>Although evidence was given at the Inquiry by senior civil servants, the Minister of the Environment, and the Premier that the risks were considered and that conclusions were reached that the risks were considered manageable, no analysis appears to have been made of the specific nature, scope, or extent of the risks or of how they could be managed.<eos/><bos/><end.quote refid="QT_0002"/>[<footnote.reference

risk management since these form important foundations of regulatory law. <eos/><bos/>It will draw on the lessons learned from Justice O&apos;Connor&apos;s Report of the Walkerton Inquiry, and discuss more recent examples of catastrophic regulatory failure including the derailment and explosion at Lac-Mégantic, Quebec, the British Petroleum oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, and the nuclear accident in Fukushima, Japan.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para></section.body></section><prop.head.footnotes><footnote
