the departure of the defendant Terry from his former employment at the plaintiff Center Stage. <eos/><bos/>Terry had worked in the Audio Visual industry for a number of years and in association with a number of different employers. <eos/><bos/>His expertise was in the field of sales and, over the years, he had developed a “stable” of clients with whom he had a close relationship and who followed him through the various changes in his employment status over several years. <eos/><bos/>Terry&apos;s various employers were in the business of assisting their clients to stage multi-media events such as conferences, presentations and the like, at venues both public and private across the country. <eos/><bos/>While clients in this industry might return repeatedly to a single supplier or relationship, contracts were almost invariably restricted to a single event or project. <eos/><bos/>In August, 2011, Terry left his prior employer and accepted a position as <begin.quote ID="QT_0004"/>“Senior Account Executive/Director of Business Development”<end.quote refid="QT_0004"/> at the plaintiff Center Stage and signed a contract of employment. <eos/><bos/>A significant element in his hire was his ability to bring with him a “book of business” represented by his existing client contacts and his ability to lever his relationship with them and familiarity with their business needs to obtain new business over time. <eos/><bos/>The plaintiff was keen to ensure that Terry entered all data from his contacts and events that he worked on with them into their proprietary data base so future use could be made of it. <eos/><bos/>Terry was not paid anything for the relationships he brought with him and the plaintiff sought no assurances regarding Terry&apos;s possible status as a fiduciary from his former employer beyond verifying that there was no non-solicitation agreement in place. <eos/><bos/>Terry&apos;s contract of employment contained a non-solicitation clause. <eos/><bos/>For just over two years, from August, 2011 until November 7, 2013, Terry worked with the plaintiff. <eos/><bos/>In October, 2013, a major contract obtained by Terry for the plaintiff with the Bank of Nova Scotia experienced technical difficulties. <eos/><bos/>The client was unhappy and sought certain discounts or credits from the plaintiff. <eos/><bos/>In the course of an exchange of emails regarding the matter of the requested discount, a principal of the plaintiff, sent a number of intemperate emails to Terry which virtually dared him to resign. <eos/><bos/>On November 5, 2013, that principal of the plaintiff and Terry had another unpleasant confrontation. <eos/><bos/>On November 7, 2013, Terry wrote to the plaintiff indicating that he was resigning with immediate effect. <eos/><bos/>The next day, Terry commenced work with the defendant Quest under a contract of employment that on its terms was economically superior to the one Terry had with the plaintiff. <eos/><bos/>Quest obtained a number of contracts after Terry joined them from six former clients of the plaintiff. <eos/><bos/>In no case was there evidence of solicitation of any of these clients by Terry. <eos/><bos/>They were, for the most part, long time contacts of Terry brought with him from when he joined the plaintiff in 2011 or, in one case, a client that a long-time client had recommended him to and who took the initiative of searching out Terry&apos;s new employer.[<eos/><bos/><footnote.reference

non-solicitation provisions of the Non-Solicitation provisions of the Employment Agreement against either defendant. <eos/><bos/>As drafted, the non-solicitation agreement would potentially prohibit Terry from earning any kind of living in the industry for a year and was manifestly unreasonable. <eos/><bos/>Neither Terry nor a prospective employer would have any basis to know which potential client was included or excluded. <eos/><bos/>A blanket prohibition on dealing with a broad, unknown data base of actual and former customers and clients or prospects of the plaintiff unrelated to actual confidential information pertaining to such customers possessed by the party being restrained is overbroad.[<eos/><bos/><footnote.reference

the plaintiff&apos;s claim was that substantially all of the client relationships that it sought to impose an exclusive protective cloak around via its equitable claims were relationships that the plaintiff had prior to allegedly becoming a fiduciary. <eos/><bos/>This was not a case of sale of a business --- the plaintiff did not buy the goodwill from Terry. <eos/><bos/>He did not possess any confidential information from them since he already possessed it before becoming associated with them. <eos/><bos/>A fiduciary, particularly one whose employment has been terminated, would not have more than the slightest of duties to the employer. <eos/><bos/>Such duties might, for example, extend to a brief period of non-solicitation that might not preclude responding to contacts initiated by the client, and certainly not in cases where there is any suggestion the employer is using the window to defame the former employee. <eos/><bos/>The parties entered into an agreement regarding non-solicitation which by its terms was inapplicable. <eos/><bos/>The court should not impose through fiduciary duties stricter limitations than the parties themselves have bargained for in their

worked with the Plaintiff Craig. <eos/><bos/>After Wilson established CEO Global, he invited Craig to join. <eos/><bos/>Craig became the executive vice-president of CEO Global. <eos/><bos/>The Consulting Agreement he signed provided for a one-year term that would automatically renew on its anniversary date subject to rights of early termination. <eos/><bos/>Part way through the second term, CEO Global provided sixty days&apos; notice to Craig of termination of the Consulting Agreement. <eos/><bos/>CEO Global agreed to pay Craig six months&apos; compensation additional to the sixty days&apos; notice, consistent with its interpretation of the Consulting Agreement&apos;s provision for termination without cause. <eos/><bos/>CEO Global paid Craig the first month of notice, but then did not pay the second month of notice or the six months of additional compensation. <eos/><bos/>CEO Global&apos;s lawyer notified Craig that CEO Global was discharged from making any further payments to him because it discovered that he had breached the non-competition provision contained in the Consulting Agreement, thereby entitling CEO Global it to terminate the Consulting Agreement for cause.[<eos/><bos/><footnote.reference refid="Id42cf8028e3111ea9d59caa7de6e97ac">28</footnote.reference>]</paratext><eos/><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>On March 29, 2019, Craig produced to

provision of the Consulting Agreement and his breach of the duty of honesty and good faith that he owed to CEO Global in the performance of the contract. <eos/><bos/>CEO Global did not tender any evidence of any harm, or detriment of any nature, resulting from Craig having had confidential documents in his possession in the more than seven years that had passed since termination.

enforce the restrictive covenant to establish that its terms are reasonable. <eos/><bos/>The Supreme Court of Canada has drawn a distinction between restrictive covenants contained in commercial contracts and in contracts pertaining to employment, noting that different considerations are pertinent to each. <eos/><bos/>In particular, in the employment setting there may be an imbalance in power between the parties to the employment contract. <eos/><bos/>The reasonableness test for assessment of a restrictive covenant has been found to be applicable to independent contractor relationships as
