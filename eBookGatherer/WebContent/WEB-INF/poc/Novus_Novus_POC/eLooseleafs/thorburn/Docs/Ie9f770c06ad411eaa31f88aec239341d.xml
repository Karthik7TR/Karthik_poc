By the early 1980s it had developed a market in Canada about ten times the size of its market in the United States, where it originated. <eos/><bos/>The appellants and their predecessors manufactured Clamato juice under licence from the respondents. <eos/><bos/>The respondents terminated the licence effective April 15, 1983. <eos/><bos/>The courts below concluded that thereafter the appellants misused confidential information related to the Clamato recipe obtained during the licence period to continue to manufacture a rival tomato-based drink. <eos/><bos/>Liability for breach of confidence was no longer contested.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>Caesar Canning Ltd. of British Columbia, now bankrupt, obtained the territory consisting of Ontario and Western Canada for a series of 12-month periods, indefinitely renewable provided the licensee achieved a minimum volume of sales in each 12-month period. <eos/><bos/>Caesar Canning easily exceeded the minimum volumes in each 12-month period. <eos/><bos/>By the spring of 1979, Caesar Canning&apos;s territory was extended to include the rest of Canada. <eos/><bos/>Local sources were obtained for the ingredients except the premixed portion of the dry seasonings, which was provided by the licensor. <eos/><bos/>Neither Caesar Canning nor the other appellants ever did discover the precise formula of the respondents&apos; secret “dry mix”.<eos/><bos/> Nevertheless, to enable Caesar Canning to produce Clamato, Duffy-Mott communicated related information about its recipe and manufacturing procedures which the trial judge found to be confidential.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>On May 11, 1981, Caesar Canning entered into a contract with the appellant FBI Foods Ltd. to manufacture Clamato and related products. <eos/><bos/>To enable it to manufacture Clamato, FBI Foods was given information about the Clamato recipe and methods of manufacture which Duffy-Mott regarded as, and FBI Foods now acknowledges was, confidential.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>In 1982, the respondent Cadbury Schweppes acquired the shares of Duffy-Mott and, in a switch of business strategy, decided that Duffy-Mott would take back the production and marketing of Clamato in Canada. <eos/><bos/>It notified Caesar Canning on April 15, 1982 that the Licence Agreement (and consequently the sub-agreement with FBI Foods) would terminate in 12 months.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The Licence Agreement left Caesar Canning, and therefore FBI Foods, free to compete with the respondent in the juice market after termination. <eos/><bos/>The Licence Agreement provided only that Caesar Canning would not, for a period of five years, manufacture or distribute any product <begin.quote ID="QT_0006"/>“which includes among its ingredients <ital>clam juice and</ital> tomato juice”<end.quote refid="QT_0006"/>. <eos/><bos/>Caesar Canning immediately began work to develop a competing product, utilizing the formula and process information about Clamato. <eos/><bos/>Caesar Canning could have developed a product as much like Clamato as Caesar Cocktail without using the Clamato recipe by hiring the appropriate skills. <eos/><bos/>It could have done so within the 12-month notice period at modest cost. <eos/><bos/>Caesar Cocktail went on the market immediately after the licensing agreement terminated on April 15, 1983. <eos/><bos/>Unbeknownst to the appellants, the respondents had surreptitiously discovered the exact formula of Caesar Cocktail at the end of March 1983 by slipping a technical expert onto the team for the final financial audit of Caesar Canning under the Licence Agreement. <eos/><bos/>Despite this knowledge, the respondents did not take any action to enjoin the manufacture and sale of Caesar Cocktail, or otherwise protest. <eos/><bos/>The respondents mistakenly believed (as did Caesar Canning) that the absence of clam broth in the reformulated recipe would be fatal to their claim. <eos/><bos/>Caesar Canning ran into serious financial problems, ceased production on October 23, 1985, and shortly thereafter made an assignment in bankruptcy. <eos/><bos/>The appellant FBI Foods purchased the assets of Caesar Canning, including the Caesar Cocktail brand. <eos/><bos/>The sale of assets was completed on January 10, 1986. <eos/><bos/>Since that time, FBI Brands has produced and sold Caesar Cocktail under various brand names throughout Canada.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><head style="l" parent="appendix.body"><bop/><bos/><headtext><bold>Reasons Given by Court for Award:</bold></headtext><eos/><eop/></head><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>Injunctive relief, whether interim, interlocutory or permanent, is available in appropriate circumstances to restrain the apprehended or continued misuse or disclosure of confidential information. <eos/><bos/>The problems here were, firstly, the delay of the respondents in asserting their rights coupled with the appellants&apos;

wrongful conduct, including their willful evasion of the terms of the injunction and contemptuous conduct, the intensely competitive nature of the generic drug business, and the interrelated aspect of Apotex&apos;s confidential technology for the production of Lovastatin, it was entirely appropriate and necessary for the scope of the injunction to prohibit entirely Novopharm&apos;s activity with respect to Lovastatin.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>By its cross-appeal Apotex asked that the injunction be extended by a further 32 months as follows: a) sixteen months to take account of the “holiday” unknown to the trial judge from February 1995 to June 1996 during which Novopharm continued to work on Lovastatin; b) for the three-month “relaxation period” permitted by the order dated March 22, 1994, until it was reversed on June 13, 1994; and c) lastly, a further 13 months, on the basis that the trial judge in awarding the initial injunction, ought to have extended it for a further 13 months so as to take complete account of the springboard advantage to Novopharm.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>During the 16-month period when the interim and trial injunctions were in place, Novopharm deliberately flouted the injunction and continued research into the production of Lovastatin. <eos/><bos/>Similarly, following the relaxation period permitted by the order of March 22, 1994, Novopharm failed to return all documentation and research results from that period. <eos/><bos/>Novopharm cheated on the injunction for 19 months. <eos/><bos/>The potential impact of such activity was especially significant to Apotex given the reality of the marketplace and the nature of the rivalry between the two corporate giants. <eos/><bos/>It was fit and proper that the original period of the injunction be effectively restored by adding back the 19 months. <eos/><bos/>The court was not persuaded that the further 13 months ought to be added to the injunction. <eos/><bos/>This time period would have been within the contemplation of the trial judge when he ordered that the term of the injunction expire on December 31, 1997, and there was no error in the exercise of his discretion in this regard.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><head style="l" parent="appendix.body"><bop/><bos/><label.name><bold>§ </bold></label.name><label.designator><bold>B:6.</bold></label.designator><headtext><bold>International Tools Ltd. v.

the knowledge they gained could not be said to be of a character <begin.quote ID="QT_0001"/>“they could not help acquiring in the activities they were authorized to carry on”<end.quote refid="QT_0001"/>. <eos/><bos/>This was not knowledge, skill and experience which as a result of this service would become their own. <eos/><bos/>It was something beyond the scope of the employment which, in the matter of their subsequent conduct, would seem to have been acquired in order to equip themselves for the commercial production of the very article in one stage of the manufacture of which they were engaged, having been warned that the employer considered the whole process of manufacture to be secret. <eos/><bos/>The defendants used substantially in their entirety the devices and processes used by the plaintiff in pin-making and bundling which the defendants copied from those of the plaintiff.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><head style="l" parent="appendix.body"><bop/><bos/><headtext><bold>Reasons Given by Court for Award:</bold></headtext><eos/><eop/></head><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>N and G were guilty of improper use of the secret process of the plaintiff from knowledge gained from the plaintiff while employed by the plaintiff, and the plaintiff was entitled to relief against them.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The position of the defendant K differed from that of his co-defendants. <eos/><bos/>He was never an employee of the plaintiff. <eos/><bos/>He was joined in the action because of his association with the other defendants in the business which involved the unauthorized use of the plaintiff&apos;s trade secrets. <eos/><bos/>It was undisputable that if the secrets became known to the defendant K they were communicated to him by either or both of his co-defendants. <eos/><bos/>If it had been established that K was an innocent purchaser from his co-defendants for value without notice he might have been in a position where he could successfully resist the plaintiff&apos;s claim for an injunction, but he did not plead this ground of defence. <eos/><bos/>The circumstances of the formation of the partnership between the defendants before the termination of the employment of the defendants N and G and the failure of the defendants to adduce any evidence to the effect that the relationship of the defendant K to his co-defendants was that of an innocent purchaser leads to no possible inference other than that the defendant K was well aware that his co-defendants would bring to their new association information about the plaintiff&apos;s trade secret extracted from the plaintiff, intended to be used and actually used in the defendants&apos;

b) concurrent with placing JingJing into bankruptcy, the IND Group companies (IND, IEI, IDI, CTS and FBI), its employees and Zhu expressly planned to use XY&apos;s Confidential Information for their own purposes in the future. <eos/><bos/>They succeeded in doing so by January 2012, which saw a resurrection of their operations in the Lower Mainland (through CTS), and either a continuation or commencement of their operations in China. <eos/><bos/>These activities arose, in part, from their use of both “real” SX parts withheld from XY and the Trustee, and also the copying of manufactured SX parts (the BSO and tips) based on further misuse of XY&apos;s Confidential Information; and c) the plan was implemented by Zhu and his key IND Group employees, while knowing full well as to the confidential nature of XY&apos;s technology, and to exacerbate matters, while doing so in the face of litigation (i.e. the Original Action) commenced by XY to protect its interests in its technology.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><head style="l" parent="appendix.body"><bop/><bos/><headtext><bold>Reasons Given by Court for Award:</bold></headtext><eos/><eop/></head><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The constructive trust relief recognized the proprietary nature of XY&apos;s Confidential Information and was consistent with enforcing XY&apos;s rights until (and if) the defendants complied with the injunctive relief granted and the injunctive relief that remained in place per the Trial Order.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The fact that Zhu and the IND Group employees, both in Canada and China, took such pains to keep their plans secret, indicated that all these individuals were well-aware that their actions were breaches of confidence. <eos/><bos/>In execution of this plan, Zhu and his employees made extensive efforts to hide their efforts. <eos/><bos/>This included: a) lying to the Trustee and XY in various respects and, in particular, misleading XY and the Court about who was the true purchaser of the cytometers;

concluded that the data met the criteria for confidentiality at common law. <eos/><bos/>In coming to this conclusion, the trial judge repeated her finding that the information had been requested and provided solely within the context of the sale of the Calcatreu Project. <eos/><bos/>In determining the question of remedy, the trial judge found that but for the prior staking of the Navidad Project by IMA, Aquiline would have staked the Navidad Project in or around May 2003 when it reviewed the data for the first time and realized its significance. <eos/><bos/>The trial judge rejected damages as an appropriate remedy on the basis that there were too many unknowns related to the value of the claims and that an award of damages could operate unfairly to the detriment of one of the

terminate the joint venture funding agreement according to its terms. <eos/><bos/>The trial judge, however, held that, as a result of the relationship between the parties as joint venturers and the nature of their agreement, TVX owed a fiduciary duty to Alpha not to acquire Kassandra except for their joint benefit, which duty survived the termination of the joint venture funding agreement. <eos/><bos/>Consequently, she held that TVX breached its fiduciary duty when it acquired Kassandra for its own account. <eos/><bos/>The trial judge found that the information provided to TVX by Alpha was not readily available in the public domain. <eos/><bos/>She held further that Alpha&apos;s information had the necessary quality of confidentiality to be worthy of protection in law. <eos/><bos/>The trial judge found that TVX used this confidential information in acquiring Kassandra in breach of the terms of the confidentiality agreement and in breach of its common law duty of confidence. <eos/><bos/>The trial judge rejected TVX&apos;s argument that Alpha had no standing to sue because the information belonged to Curragh and held that Alpha clearly had standing based on the agreements between the parties. <eos/><bos/>The trial judge noted that no argument was advanced by TVX that it had entered into an illegal contract with Alpha with respect to someone else&apos;s information. <eos/><bos/>She concluded that, without a complaint by Curragh and an action involving Curragh where the issues could be properly litigated, the court had insufficient facts upon which to conclude that the confidentiality agreement, to the extent that it concerned Curragh information, was an illegal contract.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The trial judge held

in its acquisition of Kassandra are based on correct legal principles, are entirely reasonable and supported by the evidence. <eos/><bos/>Consequently, the Court of Appeal did not interfere with the

<eos/><bos/>The judgment further provided that 478 mining claims staked by the defendant adjacent to the claims were to be held by the defendant in a constructive trust for the plaintiff.

<eos/><bos/>He was told only that the result of the drilling was “encouraging”.<eos/><bos/> He was still not shown the assay results for hole B31. <eos/><bos/>He did not examine the core samples and appears to have been relatively passive in his approach to obtaining information. <eos/><bos/>He appeared satisfied with the explanation provided by the defendant&apos;s principal C that he would provide information before the defendant&apos;s annual meeting in September. <eos/><bos/>From February 1984 until March 1986, the defendant decided to keep its deep drilling results confidential. <eos/><bos/>The purpose of its confidentiality was its desire to secure claims along the geological fault line where the discovery had been made. <eos/><bos/>It was particularly anxious to acquire the Cherbourg property and, additionally, embarked on an extensive staking program of its own. <eos/><bos/>The defendant acquired 478 claims along this geological fault between February of 1984, when C

development costs, and disclose information to the extent provided for in the agreement. <eos/><bos/>The plaintiff&apos;s predecessor, while entitled to specified information, had no role in the management of the operation; no control over the manner in which the defendant chose to conduct the exploration; and bore no responsibility, financial or otherwise, for any aspect of the work.

in the 18 claims which comprised the leased property in return for 10% of the net profit derived both from the property and the 39 claims the defendant had staked adjacent to the property. <eos/><bos/>This agreement superseded the 1981 agreement Under the agreement the plaintiff&apos;s predecessor was entitled to enter upon the property to examine the mining operations and, at its request, to be provided with the results of any diamond drilling, sampling and assaying, and to be permitted to examine relevant data, maps, reports and other records. <eos/><bos/>The defendant was no

proper disclosure having been made under the 1981 agreement. <eos/><bos/>Given the defendant&apos;s intentional failure to make proper disclosure, the 1983 agreement cannot stand. <eos/><bos/>The significance of the Winter Report in assessing the property&apos;s mining potential was manifest.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The trial judge also found that, under the 1981 and 1983 agreements, the defendant had acquired valuable geological information which it used to the exclusion of the plaintiff and in breach of its obligation to make disclosure. <eos/><bos/>He found that this information was confidential and its exclusion from the plaintiff amounted to a breach of confidence.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>Applying the reasoning in <ital>LAC</ital> to the findings of the trial judge in this case, it was clear that the defendant breached the duty of confidence which it owed to the plaintiff. <eos/><bos/>The facts were not the same as those in <ital>LAC</ital> in that the intended flow of confidential information was not from the owner of the mineral rights to the defendant but the reverse. <eos/><bos/>However, the distinction is irrelevant since the defendant was able to acquire the confidential information only because the plaintiff had given it access to its property subject to the terms of the 1981 and 1983 agreements. <eos/><bos/>The confidential information was to be shared under the two agreements but was not so shared. <eos/><bos/>It was used exclusively by the defendant to advance its own interests. <eos/><bos/>Therefore, the Court of Appeal did not interfere with the trial judge&apos;s finding that the conduct was a misuse of confidential information.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The trial judge made only a limited finding with regard to the issue of detriment, and even the limited finding that he did make did not reflect any analysis of the relevant evidence. <eos/><bos/>The finding by the trial judge that the plaintiff would have shared in the staking was incapable in law of establishing that the appropriate remedy was the imposition of a constructive trust wherein the plaintiff would receive, unburdened by any costs, the exclusive benefit of three years of exploration by the defendant on these 478 claims. <eos/><bos/>Moreover, the relevant evidence did not support the finding made. <eos/><bos/>The complaint about being left out of a joint venture for further exploration was not developed at trial and the Court of Appeal was driven to the conclusion that a restitutionary remedy for the additional 478 claims was not seriously pursued. <eos/><bos/>What little evidence there was might have been directed to a claim for damages though no such claim was advanced. <eos/><bos/>However, the evidence did not conform with what was required by La Forest J. for establishing a constructive trust. <eos/><bos/>The trial judge did not make the affirmative finding that, but for the actions of the defendant, the plaintiff would have acquired the claims in question. <eos/><bos/>No evidence was led as to what the plaintiff&apos;s predecessor would have done with respect to staking if it had known of the Winter Report in the spring of 1982. <eos/><bos/>Accordingly, the evidentiary basis for a restitutionary remedy of constructive trust of the 478 claims was restricted to the misuse of confidential information relating to the drill hole results from the summer of 1983 forward.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>It was apparent that Ontex would have required public financing to do any exploration and this would have mandated public disclosure of the drill hole assays. <eos/><bos/>It was conceded that a public announcement would have brought other players into the field. <eos/><bos/>Such a public disclosure would have lost the advantages of the confidential information that both were to share privately. <eos/><bos/>Accordingly, it is most unlikely that, but for the conduct of the defendant in withholding confidential information, the plaintiff would have staked any of the 478 claims for itself. <eos/><bos/>The plaintiff never contemplated acquiring any adjoining claims. <eos/><bos/>Its strongest claim was merely that it would have “shared” in the staking.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><head style="l" parent="appendix.body"><bop/><bos/><label.name><bold>§

(concurring in part)</ital> agreed with Justice La Forest, as to the appropriate remedy. <eos/><bos/>Since the result of LAC&apos;s breach of confidence or breach of fiduciary duty was its unjust enrichment through the acquisition of the Williams property at Corona&apos;s expense, the only sure way in which Corona can be fully compensated for the breach in this case is by the imposition of a constructive trust on LAC in favour of Corona with respect to the property. <eos/><bos/>Full compensation may or may not be achieved through an award of common law damages depending upon the accuracy of valuation techniques. <eos/><bos/>It can most surely be achieved in this case through the award of an in rem remedy. <eos/><bos/>The remedy of constructive trust is available for breach of confidence as well as for breach of fiduciary duty. <eos/><bos/>The distinction between the two causes of action as they arise on the facts of this case is a very fine one. <eos/><bos/>Where the consequence of the breach of either duty is the acquisition by the wrongdoer of property which rightfully belongs to the plaintiff or, ought to belong to the plaintiff if no agreement is reached between the negotiating parties, then the in rem remedy is appropriate to either cause of action.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><head style="l" parent="appendix.body"><bop/><bos/><label.name><bold>§ </bold></label.name><label.designator><bold>B:13.</bold></label.designator><headtext><bold>Pre-Cam Exploration &amp; Development Ltd. v.

technology products. <eos/><bos/>They set up the corporate respondent and they were all well aware of the business opportunities GasTOPS was pursuing and its proposals to potential customers. <eos/><bos/>They were in possession of the 1997 GasTOPS&apos; business plan and its strategic plan to acquire the U.S. Navy as a customer. <eos/><bos/>The trial judge held that they were crucial to the direction and guidance of the company because of their responsibilities, the roles they played in the development of the respondent&apos;s product lines, and the information they possessed.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>Subsequent to their resignations, the appellants pursued virtually every existing and potential GasTOPS customer, including the CAF and the U.S. Navy. <eos/><bos/>They used the confidential business information they had obtained while at GasTOPS to form their marketing strategy and develop their technology, the functionality of which was virtually identical to the technology they had designed and developed at GasTOPS.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><head style="l" parent="appendix.body"><bop/><bos/><headtext><bold>Reasons Given by Court for Award:</bold></headtext><eos/><eop/></head><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The trial judge, having rejected the claim for injunctive relief, ordered the corporate appellant to disgorge profits of $12,306,495.00. <eos/><bos/>He ordered damages against the four personal appellants in the same amount.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The trial judge found that all the appellants, including MxI, acquired information that was confidential to GasTOPS. <eos/><bos/>This information was both commercial (such as strategic business plans and individual customer needs) and technical (such as the details of software product design and data models).<eos/><bos/> They misused that information to advance their own business to the detriment of GasTOPS in breach of their duty of confidence to GasTOPS.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>It was the trial judge&apos;s quantification of these remedies that was the appellants&apos; primary concern on appeal. <eos/><bos/>In particular, they challenged the “accounting period” used by the trial judge to calculate the number of years of improper profits that must be disgorged and over which GasTOPS&apos; losses must be calculated and compensated.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The trial judge found that ten years was the time over which MxI earned profits in breach of its duty of confidence which it must disgorge, and ten years was the duration of the losses suffered by GasTOPS due to the breach of fiduciary duty by the four personal appellants, for which they have to pay damages. <eos/><bos/>This reflected the highly specialized nature of GasTOPS&apos; business, the time required to develop and evolve its suite of products, and the useful life of the confidential information taken from it.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>Two reasons pointed to the need for appellate deference. <eos/><bos/>First, the ten-year accounting period is an integral component of the remedy ordered by the trial judge for breach of confidence and breach of fiduciary duty. <eos/><bos/>Both these causes of action require the exercise of equitable principles. <eos/><bos/>Second, it was clear from the trial judge&apos;s reasons that the selection of ten years for the accounting period was a very fact-driven exercise. <eos/><bos/>The appellants&apos; assertion that the accounting period was not measured and proportional could not be sustained.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The trial judge did not assess the accounting period required for each cause of action separately. <eos/><bos/>He decided upon the accounting period as an integral part of the remedy for the harm caused by the combined effect of all these breaches. <eos/><bos/>The appellants could not properly look for comparison to case law dealing with only one breach, such as the breach of fiduciary duty.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>Of importance was the small and highly specialized market, the confidential business and technical information that the appellants misappropriated and continued to use, and the resulting product they sold as the next iteration of the GasTOPS suite of products. <eos/><bos/>Fair competition could not have been assured simply by according GasTOPS the time to contact its customers to attempt to maintain their loyalty. <eos/><bos/>The appellants engaged in much more that constituted unfair competition.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The appellants used the same approach to argue that the temporal limit at law for the misuse of confidential information is also capped at one to two years. <eos/><bos/>In seeking to rely on time limits from other cases, the appellants ignored the importance of the facts in each particular case. <eos/><bos/>In <cite.query w-src-number="0492176012" w-seq-number="00005" w-ref-type="IS" w-serial-number="1999428661" w-pub-number="0005156" ID="I7e5f1be18e3311ea8105c4ef24d07c52"><ital>Cadbury Schweppes Inc. v. FBI Foods Ltd.</ital></cite.query>, the Supreme Court of Canada made clear the central importance of the facts of the case in devising the remedy for breach of confidence. <eos/><bos/>In this case, the trial judge paid careful attention to the facts in settling on a ten-year accounting period. <eos/><bos/>That approach could not be faulted.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The nature of the confidential information that is misappropriated is also important. <eos/><bos/>Here both the confidential business plans with their information about particular customer needs and, even more importantly, the confidential technical information at the core of GasTOPS&apos; suite of computer programs, were “very special indeed”.<eos/><bos/> This information allowed the appellants to market their product to GasTOPS&apos; customers and potential customers as merely a seamless next step in the evolution of GasTOPS&apos; programs. <eos/><bos/>Confidential information of this nature provides strong support for the ten-year accounting period.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>Assessing the extent to which the appropriated confidential information provided the appellants with a “springboard” or a “head-start” is also important. <eos/><bos/>The appellants argue that a ten-year accounting period greatly exceeds the time limits prescribed by the “springboard” case law. <eos/><bos/>However, here too the facts of each case are most important. <eos/><bos/>In this case, those facts made clear that the advantage gained from the information misappropriated by the appellants is not measured simply by the time they would have had to take to themselves develop the last iteration of the GasTOPS suite of programs. <eos/><bos/>It must take account of the many years that went into bringing these programs from inception to where they were in the fall of 1996. <eos/><bos/>That supports a longer accounting period.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The very commercial success of the appellants (which was based on the use of this information) was supportive of a multi-year accounting period.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The respondent&apos;s request for permanent disgorgement of profits was rejected. <eos/><bos/>It essentially would be a monetized version of a permanent injunction and faces the same objections. <eos/><bos/>It was also contrary to the ten-year limit put on the accounting period by the trial judge. <eos/><bos/>That limit recognized the reality that in the rapidly changing world of technology, information gradually loses its value and utility. <eos/><bos/>At some point, it ceases to have the characteristics that require that it be cloaked in confidence. <eos/><bos/>The trial judge, in setting a ten-year accounting period, determined that this point would likely be reached in approximately that period of time. <eos/><bos/>That was a reasonable conclusion on the facts before him. <eos/><bos/>There was no basis for an order for permanent disgorgement.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><head style="l" parent="appendix.body"><bop/><bos/><label.name><bold>§ </bold></label.name><label.designator><bold>B:15.</bold></label.designator><headtext><bold>International Tools Ltd. v.

the knowledge they gained could not be said to be of a character <begin.quote ID="QT_0013"/>“they could not help acquiring in the activities they were authorized to carry on”<end.quote refid="QT_0013"/>. <eos/><bos/>This was not knowledge, skill and experience which as a result of this service would become their own. <eos/><bos/>It was something beyond the scope of the employment which, in the matter of their subsequent conduct, would seem to have been acquired in order to equip themselves for the commercial production of the very article in one stage of the manufacture of which they were engaged, having been warned that the employer considered the whole process of manufacture to be secret. <eos/><bos/>The defendants used substantially in their entirety the devices and processes used by the plaintiff in pin-making and bundling which the defendants copied from those of the plaintiff.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><head style="l" parent="appendix.body"><bop/><bos/><headtext><bold>Reasons Given by Court for Award:</bold></headtext><eos/><eop/></head><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>N and G were guilty of improper use of the secret process of the plaintiff from knowledge gained from the plaintiff while employed by the plaintiff, and the plaintiff was entitled to relief against them.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The position of the defendant K differed from that of his co-defendants. <eos/><bos/>He was never an employee of the plaintiff. <eos/><bos/>He was joined in the action because of his association with the other defendants in the business which involved the unauthorized use of the plaintiff&apos;s trade secrets. <eos/><bos/>It was undisputable that if the secrets became known to the defendant K they were communicated to him by either or both of his co-defendants. <eos/><bos/>If it had been established that K was an innocent purchaser from his co-defendants for value without notice he might have been in a position where he could successfully resist the plaintiff&apos;s claim for an injunction, but he did not plead this ground of defence. <eos/><bos/>The circumstances of the formation of the partnership between the defendants before the termination of the employment of the defendants N and G and the failure of the defendants to adduce any evidence to the effect that the relationship of the defendant K to his co-defendants was that of an innocent purchaser leads to no possible inference other than that the defendant K was well aware that his co-defendants would bring to their new association information about the plaintiff&apos;s trade secret extracted from the plaintiff, intended to be used and actually used in the defendants&apos;

Taylor and Hitkari were shareholders of the defendant, Olive either directly or through their professional corporations. <eos/><bos/>Olive was organized in December 2012 and was the company under which the Departing Physicians carried on their medical practices since February 1, 2013. <eos/><bos/>The defendant Dr. Nakhuda was a medical doctor who was employed by Genesis from February 2011 until April 2013 pursuant to an employment contract. <eos/><bos/>In June 2013, he moved his practice to Olive. <eos/><bos/>The defendants Wylie and St. Pierre were formerly senior management employees of Genesis. <eos/><bos/>On December 1, 2012, they gave notices of resignation to Genesis. <eos/><bos/>At the end of their notice period, they took up positions with Olive performing essentially the same functions for that company that they had formerly performed for Genesis.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The Departing Physicians continued to be employees, directors, and officers of Genesis in the 60 Day Period. <eos/><bos/>The procedures set out in the Shareholders&apos; Agreement required a number of steps to be taken in the 60 Day Period to complete the sale and purchase of the interest of the Departing Physicians. <eos/><bos/>There was no indication that the parties did anything to frustrate the completion of the sale transaction and the sale did complete as agreed. <eos/><bos/>As soon as Dr. Kashyap notified the Departing Physicians that she had elected to buy their shares, they, together with Wylie and St. Pierre, began to make plans to establish a new clinic in which they would continue to provide fertility treatments and consultations in the same manner that they had at Genesis. <eos/><bos/>Wylie and St. Pierre had been long time employees of Genesis and felt a great deal of personal loyalty to the Departing Physicians. <eos/><bos/>On December 1, 2012, they gave notices of termination of their employment with Genesis, effective December 31, 2012. <eos/><bos/>It is agreed that this was the required notice period under their employment contracts. <eos/><bos/>In early December 2012, the defendants took steps to incorporate Olive. <eos/><bos/>On January 1, 2013, Olive opened a temporary office in the same building in which Genesis was located. <eos/><bos/>On January 15, 2013, the Departing Physicians sent out a notice through the British Columbia Medical Association member announcement mailing service to other members of the BCMA, announcing that they were continuing their clinical practices at Olive&apos;s temporary facility and booking patients, effective immediately. <eos/><bos/>However, the Departing Physicians continued to practice at Genesis until the end of January. <eos/><bos/>On February 1, 2013, Genesis began providing some fertility medicine services from the temporary location. <eos/><bos/>The Departing Physicians used the services of Wylie and St. Pierre, during their notice period in December 2012 to assist them in setting up their new temporary and permanent clinics. <eos/><bos/>However, the great majority of time spent by Wylie and St. Pierre on establishing Olive in that month was done on their own time. <eos/><bos/>Wylie and Ms. St. Pierre were not recruited by the Departing Physicians. <eos/><bos/>They actively declared their intention to continue to work with the Departing Physicians as soon as it became possible for them to do so. <eos/><bos/>Ten Genesis employees signed employment contracts with Olive or the Departing Physicians on behalf of Olive prior to January 31, 2013. <eos/><bos/>The ten included all of the senior management team at Genesis. <eos/><bos/>Of the ten, 4 commenced employment with Olive before February 1, 2013.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><head style="l" parent="appendix.body"><bop/><bos/><headtext><bold>Reasons Given by Court for Award</bold></headtext><eos/><eop/></head><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The Departing Physicians and Senior Managers admitted that they occupied fiduciary positions with Genesis. <eos/><bos/>In Justice Sewell&apos;s view, the nature of the duties owed during the 60 Day Period must be examined in the context of the relationship between the parties. <eos/><bos/>The critical question was the extent of the duties owed by the defendants in the particular circumstances. <eos/><bos/>The Shareholders&apos; Agreement, the professional responsibilities of the Departing Physicians and the ways in which income was earned and distributed were all circumstances relevant to the determination of the extent of the permissible activities open to the Departing Physicians.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>Justice Sewell was of the view that the contractual relationship between the parties could inform the scope of the fiduciary obligations owed by one party to the other. <eos/><bos/>It was necessary to determine the nature of the relationship between the parties and, in particular, the nature of the relationship between the physicians who owned Genesis. <eos/><bos/>The starting point for that determination was the Shareholders&apos; Agreement. <eos/><bos/>The parties intended their relationship with respect to the conduct of the affairs of Genesis to be governed by the terms of the Shareholders&apos; Agreement. <eos/><bos/>The unanimity provisions of the Shareholders&apos; Agreement significantly limited the power of its directors to act in a manner that could prejudice other shareholders or Genesis itself. <eos/><bos/>Justice Laskin&apos;s explanation for the rationale of the strict application of fiduciary duties to directors of a company in <ital>Canadian Aero Service</ital> emphasized that the reason for the rule lies in the power that fiduciaries have to affect the rights of other stakeholders in the company. <eos/><bos/>In this case, that power was significantly reduced by the terms of the Shareholders&apos; Agreement. <eos/><bos/>Justice Sewell also consider that the fact that Genesis was a corporation set up to permit the physicians to practice medicine together was relevant because, as practicing physicians, they were subject to a number of express regulations, fiduciary duties and ethical constraints with respect to the provision of medical services to patients. <eos/><bos/>The most important of these was the ethical duty all the physicians to facilitate continuity of care for patients and the right of those patients to receive care from the physician of their choice. <eos/><bos/>The ethical code and standards stress the importance of the patient-physician relationship and generally oppose the termination of the relationship without “legitimate reasons”.<eos/><bos/> The board of the College adopted the Canadian Medical Association&apos;s Code of Ethics as the baseline for all conduct of physicians in B.C. One such fundamental responsibility stated in the Code of Ethics is that a physician must <begin.quote ID="QT_0004"/>“consider first the well-being of the patient.”<eos/><bos/><end.quote refid="QT_0004"/> Rule 19 of the Code of Ethics states that a physician must <begin.quote ID="QT_0003"/>“having accepted professional responsibility for a patient, continue to provide services until they are no longer required or wanted; until another suitable physician has assumed responsibility for the patient; or until the patient has been given reasonable notice that you intend to terminate the relationship”<end.quote refid="QT_0003"/>. <eos/><bos/>The College has provided a further practice standard titled “Ending the Patient-Physician Relationship” that expands on the duties that physicians owe to their patients. <eos/><bos/>The practice standard states: <begin.quote ID="QT_0002"/>“the patient-physician relationship is a fiduciary relationship based on honesty, respect and trust, where the physician prioritizes the patient&apos;s care and well-being, and acknowledges the patient&apos;s autonomy with regard to personal choice, including lifestyle or treatment options. <eos/><bos/>One such personal choice is the ability of patients to choose which physician should treat them. <eos/><bos/>It is also clear that the patient-physician relationship should not be ended by a physician unless there are serious reasons for doing so.<eos/><end.quote refid="QT_0002"/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>Justice Sewell explained that if physicians are to uphold their ethical obligations to their patient and respect patient choice, the patient must have the right to be informed of changes to a medical practice and has the right to choose which physician is to treat them, including the right to change clinics at any time. <eos/><bos/>The jurisprudence recognizes that the nature of the fiduciary duties owed in a corporation established to deliver professional services must be modified to accommodate the fiduciary and ethical duties owed to patients and clients and the ethical responsibilities of professionals.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>Justice Sewell appreciated that there were a number of factual differences between the authorities and this case. <eos/><bos/>Genesis was a corporation and the Departing Physicians owed fiduciary duties to it. <eos/><bos/>The solicitation to which the plaintiffs objected in this case was not made to patients but to referring physicians. <eos/><bos/>The Departing Physicians left Genesis pursuant to the terms of the Shareholders&apos; Agreement and received a substantial payment for their interest in Genesis. <eos/><bos/>However, the underlying principle that giving priority to the duties owed by doctors to their patients takes precedence over some fiduciary duties to their employer that might apply in other circumstances applied in this case.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The plaintiffs expressly stated that they did not object to the defendants communicating with patients. <eos/><bos/>They did, however, say that the notice to the medical profession sent out in January 2013 was a breach of duty. <eos/><bos/>The difficulty that Justice Sewell had with that submission was that the Departing Physicians were specialists. <eos/><bos/>As a general rule in British Columbia, patients must be referred to a specialist by another physician for consultations. <eos/><bos/>A restriction on the ability of the Departing Physicians to communicate with referring doctors is also an unacceptable restriction on the right of patients to be treated by the doctor of their choice. <eos/><bos/>It is also in the public interest that referring physicians be provided with up to date and accurate information as to the professional staff of a clinic to whom they are making referrals.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The combined effect of the contractual arrangement between the parties and the fiduciary, regulatory and ethical duties owed to patients led Justice Sewell to conclude that the Departing Physicians were entitled to take significant steps to establish a new clinic as soon as they knew they were being bought out of Genesis and would no longer be practicing there. <eos/><bos/>Within the 60 Day Period the Departing Physicians were entitled to secure new premises for their practices, to make arrangements to permit them to provide uninterrupted medical services to their patients and to inform other physicians of the establishment of their new practice. <eos/><bos/>These steps included making staffing arrangements within reasonable limits. <eos/><bos/>The Departing Physicians did not breach their fiduciary duties as directors of Genesis by taking immediate steps to set up a new clinic once they were made aware that they could not practice at Genesis, provided that they acted fairly in doing so.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The plaintiffs alleged that many steps taken by the defendants damaged Genesis&apos;s interests and constituted breaches of fiduciary duty or unauthorized use of confidential information.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>With respect to the removal of payroll information as well as the information used by Olive in the preparation of its business plan, it was a breach of confidence and breach of fiduciary duty to use that information without Genesis&apos;s consent.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>Justice Sewell considered that it was a breach of fiduciary duty on the part of the Departing Physicians not to inform Dr. Kashyap that they had entered into employment contracts with the Senior Managers and to use the services of the Senior Managers while they were still employed by Genesis. <eos/><bos/>However, once they were no longer employed by Genesis, the Senior Managers were entitled to work to prepare the Olive clinic to be able to begin providing patient care on February 1, 2013. <eos/><bos/>There were times when Wylie and St. Pierre performed services relating to setting up Olive while they were working in Genesis&apos;s office. <eos/><bos/>However, this occurred only rarely and both Wylie and St. Pierre competently carried out their duties for Genesis during December 2012. <eos/><bos/>There was no evidence of any material amount of Olive related services being carried out by either of these defendants when they should have been working for Genesis.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The signing of employment contracts with other Genesis employees within the 60 Day Period without making full disclosure to Genesis was a breach of fiduciary duty on the part of the Departing Physicians.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>Justice Sewell accepted that Wylie used financial information about Genesis&apos;s operations in preparing the Olive Business Plan and for the purpose of preparing contracts of employment with Genesis employees. <eos/><bos/>This was a breach of fiduciary duty and an appropriation of Genesis&apos;s confidential information. <eos/><bos/>However, this information was not of significant importance to Olive or Genesis.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>While Justice Sewell did not accept that Dr. Kashyap was kept completely in the dark about their activities, Genesis was entitled to be kept informed of the Departing Physicians&apos; activities to allow it to manage its own future. <eos/><bos/>As fiduciaries, the Departing Physicians had a duty of candour as well as loyalty. <eos/><bos/>In Justice Sewell&apos;s view, they did not fulfill their duty of candour during the 60 Day Period. <eos/><bos/>Genesis did go through a period of uncertainty and disruption after Dr. Kashyap elected to purchase the Departing Physicians shares. <eos/><bos/>However, those difficulties were not primarily attributable to any breaches of duty or wrongdoing on the part of the defendants. <eos/><bos/>Dr. Kashyap undoubtedly had the right to buy out the Departing Physicians. <eos/><bos/>However, she did not think through the practical consequences of her decision in several important respects. <eos/><bos/>The first of these was she was purchasing a company whose most valuable assets were the doctors who practiced in the clinic. <eos/><bos/>Dr. Kashyap must be taken to have realized that much of the financial success of Genesis was derived from the personal reputations and abilities of the doctors who practiced in it. <eos/><bos/>Her decision to buyout the Departing Physicians resulted in the immediate loss of three of its five Physicians, and the likely departure of a fourth. <eos/><bos/>The second consideration was that the number of employees, the amount of equipment and the infrastructure associated with Genesis were all designed to support a clinic in which 4 or 5 doctors would be practicing. <eos/><bos/>In this regard, the number of doctors practicing at Genesis was the limiting factor on both its size and the amount of revenue it could generate. <eos/><bos/>The third consideration was that the Shareholders&apos; Agreement made it clear that the Departing Doctors had an unrestricted right to immediately begin competing with Genesis as soon as they ceased to be Shareholders. <eos/><bos/>The fourth consideration was that many of the employees of Genesis would be likely to leave that company and seek work elsewhere as soon as they were in a position to do so. <eos/><bos/>This was so for two reasons. <eos/><bos/>Firstly, Genesis clearly had more staff than it reasonably required to provide support for a one or two physician practice. <eos/><bos/>Secondly, many of the staff had worked closely with the Departing Physicians for many years and would naturally have wished to continue to do so. <eos/><bos/>Dr. Kashyap lacked a plan for dealing with these difficulties. <eos/><bos/>The lack of such a plan greatly contributed to her difficulties. <eos/><bos/>None of these difficulties can be attributed to any wrongful acts on the part of the defendants.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants breached their fiduciary duties after the 60 Day Period by continuing to use confidential information belonging to Genesis and by continuing to covertly gather information about Genesis and its employees from Collings and using that information to recruit Genesis employees Collings continued to work at Genesis in a managerial role after she had decided to move to Olive. <eos/><bos/>It was clear that she was acting in the interests of Olive in making decisions about staffing matters at Genesis. <eos/><bos/>Collings remained at Genesis until May 16, 2013. <eos/><bos/>During that period, she frequently communicated with Wylie about Genesis employees and made recommendations as to which employees Olive should consider hiring. <eos/><bos/>Utilizing information obtained from Collings was a breach of fiduciary duty on the part of the fiduciary defendants. <eos/><bos/>It also constituted improper use of confidential information about Genesis&apos;s operations and human resources challenges. <eos/><bos/>Unlike many of the other breaches complained of, the actions of Collings were damaging to Genesis.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>Genesis had established some breaches of fiduciary duty and some breaches of confidence. <eos/><bos/>A plaintiff that establishes breaches of fiduciary duty and breach of confidence is entitled to compensation either as damages for losses incurred or by an order requiring the defendant to account for any gains wrongfully obtained.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>Genesis left it up to the court to determine an award of compensation that was supported by the evidence. <eos/><bos/>Justice Sewell concluded that it was entitled to do so and was not required to elect one remedy or the other.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>Determining an appropriate remedy in this case presented challenges that were not present in many of the cases relied upon by the plaintiffs. <eos/><bos/>Most of those cases involved a central act that was a breach of fiduciary duty. <eos/><bos/>In such cases, less serious breaches of duty can be viewed as being done pursuant to an object that was itself a breach. <eos/><bos/>In this case, however, the Departing Physicians had the right to set up a competing clinic within which to practice and the benefit they obtained came from that lawful activity. <eos/><bos/>Justice Sewell explained that the Court must be careful not to deprive them of that benefit in any remedy granted.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>In addition, the authorities make it clear that any remedy must be restitutionary and the object should be to put the plaintiff in as good a position it would have been in had there been no breach. <eos/><bos/>The court must therefore fashion a remedy that is appropriate to the wrong established. <eos/><bos/>The Departing Physicians breached their fiduciary duty to Genesis to act fairly in the following ways: a) By entering into employment agreements with Wylie and St. Pierre and other Genesis employees while the Departing Physicians continued to be directors of Genesis without making proper disclosure of that fact to Genesis b) By utilizing confidential information of Genesis in the preparation of Olive&apos;s business plan c) By utilizing confidential information of Genesis in connection with hiring Genesis employees. <eos/><bos/>The Departing Physicians breached the Shareholders&apos; Agreement by utilizing Genesis&apos;s financial information. <eos/><bos/>Wylie wrongfully used confidential information belonging to Genesis and failed to disclose to Dr. Kashyap that she had signed an employment contract with the Departing Physicians. <eos/><bos/>As a fiduciary, Wylie owed a duty to disclose that fact to Dr. Kashyap. <eos/><bos/>She also breached her fiduciary duty by conferring with Collings about what Genesis employees Olive should offer employment to while Collings was employed as head of the nursing department at Genesis. <eos/><bos/>The only breach of fiduciary duty St. Pierre committed was her failure to disclose to Dr. Kashyap that she had signed an employment agreement with the Departing Physicians. <eos/><bos/>There was no evidence that St. Pierre removed or misused any confidential information belonging to Genesis.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The preferred remedy sought by the plaintiffs was a judgment equal to the price the Plaintiffs paid to purchase the business of Genesis. <eos/><bos/>The fundamental factual premise of this was that the Defendants, immediately upon Dr. Kashyap becoming obliged to pay the $4.275 million for their shares, set out to destroy that very business that they had just sold to Dr. Kashyap.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>Justice Sewell concluded that the plaintiffs failed to establish entitlement to this remedy. <eos/><bos/>The fundamental obstacle to granting this remedy was that Genesis was not a party to the share purchase agreement. <eos/><bos/>This remedy would therefore be appropriate only if Dr. Kashyap established a basis for it. <eos/><bos/>She had not established a breach of the contract pursuant to which the shares were purchased from the Departing Physicians. <eos/><bos/>On this ground alone, the claim for return of the purchase price must fail. <eos/><bos/>In addition, the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the Departing Physicians set out to destroy the business they had just sold to Dr. Kashyap. <eos/><bos/>The object pursued by the Departing Physicians was to continue to practice medicine together in their area of specialty. <eos/><bos/>In pursuing that objective, they breached certain duties to Genesis. <eos/><bos/>They did not destroy Dr. Kashyap&apos;s practice or deprive her of the right to utilize the assets of Genesis for that purpose. <eos/><bos/>The wrongful acts of the Departing Physicians were not the reason for most of the difficulties Genesis faced.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>As an alternative remedy, the plaintiffs sought an order that the Departing Physicians disgorge all benefits earned by the Defendants for a period of two years. <eos/><bos/>Justice Sewell concluded that such a remedy would be disproportionate to any wrongs done by the defendants. <eos/><bos/>The first difficulty with it was that it ignored the contractual right of the Departing Physicians to compete with Genesis. <eos/><bos/>Genesis&apos;s claim for a disgorgement of profits also failed to recognize that the defendants were only required to disgorge any benefits they received from their breach of duty. <eos/><bos/>They are not required to disgorge any benefits they obtained from lawful activity on their part. <eos/><bos/>Substantially all of the benefits the Departing Shareholders earned from Olive were acquired from their skill, effort and professional standing in the medical profession. <eos/><bos/>There was no indication that the Departing Physicians received a significant benefit from their breaches of fiduciary duty. <eos/><bos/>The breaches they committed did not make any material contribution to their success. <eos/><bos/>The stringent rule requiring a fiduciary to account for profits should not be carried to extremes and should not be transformed into a vehicle for the unjust enrichment of the plaintiff.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The defendant&apos;s conduct with respect to recruiting Genesis&apos;s employees and their failure to be candid with Genesis about their organizational activities in the 60 Day Period, did cause some harm to Genesis. <eos/><bos/>In addition, the conduct of Collings constituted unfair competition after the 60 Day Period. <eos/><bos/>As these were breaches of equitable duties, compensation for them must be assessed on equitable principles. <eos/><bos/>In assessing claims for damages or equitable compensation for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of confidence, the courts do not require the same degree of certainty as in cases of breach of contract or tort.

appellants urged us to accept the manner of calculating compensation adopted by the courts in trust cases or situations akin to a trust, and they relied in particular on the Guerin case, supra. <eos/><bos/>I think the courts below were perfectly right to reject that proposition. <eos/><bos/>There is a sharp divide between a situation where a person has control of property which in the view of the court belongs to another, and one where a person is under a fiduciary duty to perform an obligation where equity&apos;s concern is simply that the duty be performed honestly and in accordance with the undertaking the fiduciary has taken on; see Sealy, “Some Principles of Fiduciary Obligation”, [1963] Cambridge L.J. 119; Sealy, “Fiduciary Relationships”, [1962] Cambridge L.J. 69. <eos/><bos/>In the case of a trust relationship, the trustee&apos;s obligation is to hold the res or object of the trust for his cestui que trust, and on breach the concern of equity is that it be restored to the cestui que trust or if that cannot be done to afford compensation for what the object would be worth. <eos/><bos/><ital>In the case of a mere breach of duty, the concern of equity is to ascertain the loss resulting from the breach of the particular duty. <eos/><bos/>Where the wrongdoer has received some benefit, that benefit can be disgorged, but the measure of compensation where

conduct.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>Justice Sewell was satisfied that there was a causal link between additional training time for new nurses and conduct of Collings on Olive&apos;s behalf. <eos/><bos/>However, the evidence as to the actual amount of training time incurred was deficient. <eos/><bos/>However, many nurses left Genesis for reasons unrelated to any actions on the part of the defendants. <eos/><bos/>Genesis was entitled to an award of $10,000 for this claim. <eos/><bos/>This award took into account the fact that it would have been expected that there would have been significant staffing changes that resulted from the departure of the Departing Physicians and the attendant reduction of the size of its operations. <eos/><bos/>Many of the nurses who left Genesis did so because of their long association with the Departing Physicians and unhappiness with the working environment at Genesis and not because of any wrongful recruiting activities. <eos/><bos/>These factors justified a lower assessment of damages for this claim.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>Genesis claimed for lost revenue from PGD cycles that Lafreniere referred on to Olive while he was employed at Genesis. <eos/><bos/>Olive accepted these referrals without seeking or obtaining Genesis&apos;s consent. <eos/><bos/>The opportunity to do these cycles was a corporate opportunity belonging to Genesis that Olive had no right to appropriate without Genesis&apos;s informed consent or if the patient made an independent decision to choose to use Olive. <eos/><bos/>Malice or bad faith are not essential elements of a claim for the wrongful appropriation of a corporate opportunity. <eos/><bos/>To succeed in a claim to require an accounting all that Genesis needs to establish is that it did not give its informed consent. <eos/><bos/>Genesis established a claim for the diversion of referrals. <eos/><bos/>Justice Sewell accepted Genesis&apos;s evidence that it earned a profit of $7,458 per cycle and therefore award rounded damages of $40,000 for this claim.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>Genesis advanced a claim of $61,643 for wages paid to staff members for December 2012 and January 2013. <eos/><bos/>All of the employees in question continued to fulfill their employment obligations to Genesis in the relevant periods and Genesis accordingly has had the benefit of the services they performed. <eos/><bos/>However, Genesis was entitled to some measure of compensation for the time the named staff employees were paid while they were performing services for Olive. <eos/><bos/>It is impossible to determine the value of that time with any degree of certainty. <eos/><bos/>An award of $15,000, being approximately 25% of the wages paid was reasonable. <eos/><bos/>This award was primarily based on the conduct of Collings and Wylie&apos;s cooperation in and knowledge of that conduct.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>Genesis claimed reimbursement of a number of expenses it paid which it alleged should be charged to the Departing Physicians. <eos/><bos/>The Departing Physicians retained Weir and Company to provide advice with respect to the tax implications of purchasing Dr. Kashyap&apos;s shares in Genesis. <eos/><bos/>Genesis paid these fees. <eos/><bos/>These expenses should properly have been born by the shareholders who incurred them. <eos/><bos/>Genesis paid dues for the Departing Physicians in January 2013 for the College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia, the British Columbia Medical Association and another professional organization to which Dr. Yuzpe belonged. <eos/><bos/>These dues presumably related to the 2013 calendar year, during which the Departing Physicians worked at Olive for 11 months. <eos/><bos/>Genesis should not have paid for dues which permitted the Departing Physicians to continue their practice at Olive. <eos/><bos/>Accordingly, the defendants were liable for 11/12 of these items. <eos/><bos/>The total of these items was $10,274.49. 11/12ths of that amount was rounded to $9,420.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The defendants conceded that fees related to billings for private practice billings to MSP were properly chargeable to the Departing

Olive in evaluating Genesis staff as future Olive employees. <eos/><bos/>Olive obtained a benefit from the prepayment of these fees. <eos/><bos/>When the fees were paid, the Departing Physicians had an expectation that many of the employees on whose behalf they were paid would eventually move to their new clinic. <eos/><bos/>The defendants failed to make adequate disclosure of their intention to hire these staff members. <eos/><bos/>Even if the defendants did not wrongfully recruit these employees they should not have caused Genesis to pay their fees in full without fully informing Dr. Kashyap that they considered it appropriate to offer employment to them. <eos/><bos/>In these particular circumstances, Justice Sewell allowed this claim, which was rounded up to $3680.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>Although it was not specifically sought by Genesis, Justice Sewell considered that some award was appropriate for the disruption caused to it by the lack of candour of the Departing Physicians in informing Genesis about their activities during the 60 Day Period. <eos/><bos/>The unfair competition engaged in by Olive through Collings&apos; activities also warranted an award of compensation. <eos/><bos/>The amount of such an award could not be tied to any specific claim, nor could it be measured with any degree of certainty. <eos/><bos/>Given the size of Genesis&apos;s operation, the amounts paid to the Departing Shareholders, the revenue generated by Olive and the fact that Olive did make use of confidential information belonging to Genesis, particularly in preparing its application for Bank financing and from information obtained from Collings, Justice Sewell considered an award of $100,000 to be appropriate.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>Genesis sought an award of punitive damages. <eos/><bos/>Justice Sewell concluded that the conduct of the defendants did not rise to the level of a marked departure from the ordinary standards of human decency.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The defendants no doubt exhibited a high level of animosity to Dr. Kashyap. <eos/><bos/>However, the case against them rested principally upon an allegation of breaches of fiduciary duty. <eos/><bos/>The underpinning of Genesis&apos;s case was that the defendants who were found to be fiduciaries preferred their own interests over that of the company to which they owed fiduciary duties. <eos/><bos/>However, Justice Sewell rejected Genesis&apos;s submission that the defendants set out to destroy it or acted maliciously and with a view to injure it. <eos/><bos/>In the particular context of this case, in which the defendants genuinely felt aggrieved at losing the business they had built up over many years, their conduct, although wrongful in some respects, was not so egregious as to warrant an award of punitive damages.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><head

It was a “Catch 22”: in effect, the government would not give TDC the money necessary for their progress because TDC did not have the ability to pay their existing bills and was not attracting new investor money. <eos/><bos/>Having the only technology that was proven to work was not sufficient to overcome their lack of capital, or business acumen.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>There were two significant aspects of the plaintiff&apos;s confidential information used by the defendant to construct the RFP. The first was the Business Proposal. <eos/><bos/>The second was 5 different aspects of the TDC information in the pilot RFP. The defendant did not include TDC information in the pilot RFP that detailed the most valuable part of the delivery system, which was the overall assembly of the many off the shelf constituent hardware parts together with Dennis Cockerill&apos;s configurations that made them work together. <eos/><bos/>Also, the evidence did not support a conclusion that Seaside had the ability to or did deploy the TDC delivery system in the Cumberland pilot. <eos/><bos/>Nor did the evidence demonstrate that other bidders subsequently deployed a system based upon the pilot RFP information.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><head style="l" parent="appendix.body"><bop/><bos/><headtext><bold>Reasons Given by Court for Award:</bold></headtext><eos/><eop/></head><head style="l" parent="appendix.body"><bop/><bos/><headtext><ital>Reasons for Decision of the Trial judge</ital></headtext><eos/><eop/></head><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The plaintiff submitted that the defendant&apos;s breach of confidence caused it to suffer a compensable loss. <eos/><bos/>TDC sought damages for economic loss in the amount of $2,495,000; special damages associated with its bankruptcy in the amount of $56,147; general damages of $300,000; punitive damages of $275,000; together with prejudgment interest, costs and disbursements. <eos/><bos/>The plaintiff&apos;s focus was on demonstrating the complete loss of value for the delivery system. <eos/><bos/>The calculation of damages flowed from that premise. <eos/><bos/>The trial judge concluded that the loss of value was something less than that claimed.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>TDC was the only company that had attempted to provide fixed wireless broadband to this very difficult and underserved segment of the Nova Scotia marketplace, but it had not shown that its system was financially viable. <eos/><bos/>If it had the necessary funding from non-governmental sources then it could have continued to operate, notwithstanding the Province&apos;s decision to “enter the fray”.<eos/><bos/> Refusing to award TDC the pilot on the basis of its lack of financial stability, business acumen, lack of customer support and service capability is not the same as setting up a process whereby competition is eliminated from the market through the designation of a single company or group of companies to be the sole provider of that service. <eos/><bos/>The Cumberland RFP demonstrated that there was competition in the marketplace.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The trial judge was satisfied that without a substantial contribution of government funding and a significant rapid development of its business expertise TDC would not have been able to continue to develop its operations beyond 2006, with or without the Province&apos;s decision to support other providers. <eos/><bos/>There was no evidence that TDC could meet either of its needs, in particular because the requisite business experience was dependent upon non-existent funds to hire qualified people to take the company forward.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The trial judge agreed, in part, that but for the intervention of the government into the marketplace TDC would have had options to its further progress, including that it could have licenced, sold or partnered and used the Delivery System for their profit.<eos/><bos/><begin.quote ID="QT_0018"/>” TDC was too confident in its belief that the strength of its technology could overcome the company&apos;s financial problems. <eos/><bos/>There was an erroneous assumption that the Province would have to do business with TDC. It was easy to see in hindsight that once it became apparent that there was insufficient capital available to carry on the business the company needed to: 1. Partner with someone who had the resources to take the development and distribution of its technology to the next level; or 2. Hire themselves out to the Province or another ISP on a consulting basis to share their expertise; or 3. Sell the rights to the delivery system. <eos/><bos/>These were TDC&apos;s only viable options. <eos/><bos/>Seaside was interested in a collaboration with TDC as of July 2006 and it was TDC who walked away from the discussions. <eos/><bos/>There was no evidence that TDC attempted to partner with any other person or company. <eos/><bos/>The Province provided TDC with opportunities to engage with Flam. <eos/><bos/>TDC representatives did not act on this advice. <eos/><bos/>There was no evidence that TDC made efforts to explore licencing or sale of its product. <eos/><bos/>The option to licence, sell or partner was certainly open to TDC at least until the award of the Cumberland Pilot, which was before the successful bidder would have to begin developing their delivery system. <eos/><bos/>The extent to which it was still an option until TDC&apos;s May 2007 bankruptcy depends upon the extent to which the Cumberland RFP damaged the commercial value of the TDC confidential information.<eos/><end.quote refid="QT_0018"/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The claim of “economic loss” is intended to provide compensatory damages for harm to economic interests. <eos/><bos/>The trial judge was satisfied that the TDC delivery system and Business Proposal had value and that some of that value was lost by the inclusion of TDC&apos;s confidential information in the Cumberland RFP. Further, a sum that recognizes the value to the Province for its use of the plaintiff&apos;s confidential information was also an appropriate basis upon which to assess damages. <eos/><bos/>The trial judge did not agree that most or all of the value of the delivery system was lost by the disclosure to bidders of TDC&apos;s information in the Cumberland RFP. As such, the defendant should not be liable for the entire value of the cost of developing the Delivery System.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The extent of the damage to the commercial value of the plaintiff&apos;s confidential information was integral to the assessment of the loss suffered. <eos/><bos/>Specifically, the trial judge found that: (a) The pilot RFP contained TDC information that conveyed to Seaside (and other bidders) the general structure of the TDC system, but did not reveal all of the technical detail necessary to duplicate the TDC system; (b) Seaside did not use the most technologically advanced aspects of the TDC delivery system in the pilot area, likely because it did not have the intellectual property that Dennis Cockerill held to himself; (c) The choice of the coverage area of Cumberland County set out in the pilot RFP provided a much less challenging topography than Caledonia and almost certainly guaranteed the technological success of Seaside&apos;s pilot without using the TDC technology. <eos/><bos/>As such, the advantages of TDC&apos;s delivery system were not as necessary to the success of the pilot project; (d) The choice of Cumberland County for the pilot also offered a greater potential for subscriber uptake, by reason of the demographics for that area as compared to Caledonia; (e) The provincial RTF issued in 2007 contained further technical information that was consistent with the TDC system but still did not provide detailed specifications or configurations that were held only by Dennis Cockerill; (f) The use of the Motorola Canopy system was known to the industry and in particular to Seaside which was already using it as part of a fixed wireless delivery system in certain parts of Cape Breton in the summer of 2006; (g) The Province could not grant TDC an exclusive right to use the 900 MHz spectrum—that was a factor controlled by Industry Canada; (h) The Province did not and would not have entered into a contract providing TDC with the exclusive use of its towers to provide Broadband delivery. <eos/><bos/>TDC would have received a licence to use the towers but because of TDC&apos;s constantly changing plans an agreement was never finalized; (i) During the period of its lease of the provincially owned towers TDC could expect to be the beneficiary of a similar clause to that in their draft agreement, that is, that no subsequent user could install in a way that interfered with the signals of existing tower users. <eos/><bos/>The result could have aided TDC in maintaining any competitive edge it had by getting to the market with its product before other ISPs, but it was not a guarantee against competition that also used the towers; (j) TDC overreached by trying to widely expand when it should have been consolidating in more profitable areas while it had the capital to do so; (k) TDC had exhausted its funding by the summer of 2006, and did not have a viable business plan in the absence of government funding; (l) The Province had no legal obligation to TDC to support its business nor to ensure its ongoing viability; (m) It was unrealistic for TDC to assume that the Province would sole source contracts of this magnitude and complexity, or that the Province would skew the tender process so as to overlook the financial instability and customer service inadequacies of TDC; (n) There was no basis upon which TDC could have been justified to rely upon the defendant to provide funding for its operations; (o) By the time of the trial, Premier MacDonald&apos;s promise of 100% broadband coverage in Nova Scotia was still not achieved despite the expenditure of millions of dollars by the defendant.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The trial judge concluded that “something special” was misused by the defendant. <eos/><bos/>This information provided great value to the Rural Broadband team in drafting its pilot RFP and in being able to do so quickly, which was crucial to Flam&apos;s superiors. <eos/><bos/>In effect, TDC&apos;s information educated the Project members in a highly complicated technology where otherwise its only apparent source of technical information was Dan MacDonald, who was not an expert in the field. <eos/><bos/>Learning what the issues were and determining the ways to address those problems made that information a valuable asset. <eos/><bos/>However, what ultimately ended up in the RFP was an identification of the issues and not a lot of the answers arrived at by TDC. However, the RFP designers were not experts in the industry and so the TDC information that the Project members sought and obtained provided a shortcut, which the defendant did not have the permission to take and did not pay for. <eos/><bos/>The Province gained from the knowledge acquired by TDC&apos;s principals over an extended period of time. <eos/><bos/>There is an important difference though between what the Rural Broadband Project team members knew of the TDC delivery system and Business Proposal, and what it misused. <eos/><bos/>The defendant was only liable for that which it provably misused. <eos/><bos/>There was no basis upon which to conclude that members of the Rural Broadband project passed on any TDC confidential information to Seaside or the other bidders in ways other than that set out in the pilot RFP. Once the pilot RFP was released the extent of the damage to TDC had crystallized. <eos/><bos/>There was no basis upon which the defendant would have required TDC&apos;s further assistance, unless it was prepared to seek the undisclosed and more valuable TDC information held by Dennis Cockerill. <eos/><bos/>It did not and so TDC could not be compensated for that which it did not provide. <eos/><bos/>The value of the plaintiff&apos;s economic loss was to be measured by considering the value to the Province of retaining TDC to assist the Rural Broadband Project between the Project&apos;s inception in March 2006 and the release of the RFP in September 2006; and also as a product of the intrinsic value of the information that was lost by TDC and gained by the defendant. <eos/><bos/>A way of looking at the value of the misused information is the cost that would be agreed to by a willing buyer and a willing seller where the product purchased was the provision of TDC&apos;s information and in person expertise, together with the right for the Project to use the information for the development of the Rural Broadband project and the construction of the pilot RFP. In giving up this information to the Province there would be a corresponding diminishment in the overall commercial value of the information provided by TDC, once published in the RFP. The value of the plaintiff&apos;s economic loss was $125,000.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The bankruptcy of TDC was not causally connected to the defendant&apos;s tortious conduct. <eos/><bos/>The bankruptcy was an inevitable result of the Plaintiff&apos;s inability to find new capital or to develop an adequate revenue stream to maintain its operations. <eos/><bos/>The market place was still open to TDC after the Province initiated the Rural Broadband project. <eos/><bos/>Any ISP that was not selected in the tender process was free to compete to the limit of its financial and technological capabilities. <eos/><bos/>TDC did not have the funding to continue.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The plaintiff claimed general damages in the amount of $300,000 for loss of goodwill and business reputation. <eos/><bos/>There was no evidence to support the conclusion that the plaintiff suffered a loss of goodwill and business reputation that was caused by the defendant. <eos/><bos/>No valuation of these assets had been tendered and having regard to the evidence it was unlikely that there was significant value in these accounts by the time the pilot RFP was made public in September 2006. <eos/><bos/>By August 2006 TDC was unable to raise funding. <eos/><bos/>The uptake of service was significantly less than what was anticipated and there was an interruption of service that month due to non-payment of bills. <eos/><bos/>The evidence supported the conclusion that TDC&apos;s business reputation and technical reputation were already seriously damaged before the publication of the pilot RFP.

counsel that he should assume 100% of sales or gifts of MyPakage product, beginning in 2011, equated to lost sales of SAXX product, and then apply Saxx Apparel profit margins to those figures. <eos/><bos/>He also assumed without any evidentiary basis that any loss of sales of SAXX product due to sales of the MyPakage product would increase by 20% each year from 2011 through 2018, and projected a total loss of sales of just over $23 million. <eos/><bos/>No independent evidence, such as that by a business valuator, was tendered to justify McCurry&apos;s calculations, including: the 20% increase, the time span of the claim, and the fact there were no allowances for contingencies and no present valuing of this enormous claim. <eos/><bos/>There was no evidentiary basis on which one could conclude that McCurry&apos;s calculation was a fair assessment of the plaintiffs&apos; damages. <eos/><bos/>The plaintiffs called no evidence as to their market share or market position in relation to other brands of men&apos;s underwear in 2009 or subsequently. <eos/><bos/>There was therefore no evidence capable of supporting factual conclusions as to what the plaintiffs could have achieved in sales of the SAXX product, but for alleged sales of MyPakage product, compared to what the plaintiffs did actually achieve in sales of the SAXX product after the alleged misconduct and launch of the MyPakage product.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>While the equitable principles upon which a claim for breach of confidence is based are flexible, there still needs to be some evidence to support the remedy claimed.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>There was not the proper evidentiary support on which to base a finding that the MyPakage product and MyPakage marketing efforts had a negative impact on the plaintiffs&apos;

the plaintiff&apos;s financial statements; and an outline of the plaintiff&apos;s operational plan for the marine fuel business. <eos/><bos/>The trial judge observed that equity is “quick to protect confidences” and sets a “relatively low threshold” on the type of information capable of providing the foundation for a breach of confidence claim. <eos/><bos/>The trial judge had no difficulty in concluding that the information as to the barge condition and value, the information in the financial statements, and the aspects of the “operational plan” was confidential information and accepted on that basis by Weiwaikum. <eos/><bos/>The plaintiff&apos;s documents were manifestly confidential. <eos/><bos/>The information in them would have been known to very few outside of the plaintiff, was acquired by the expenditure of the plaintiff&apos;s money or its effort, and could not be easily acquired or duplicated by others. <eos/><bos/>The defendants received the information from business letters exchanged during the course of commercial negotiations. <eos/><bos/>The reasonable person standing in the shoes of the defendants would have realized on reasonable grounds that the information was being given by the plaintiff in confidence, and the equitable duty of confidence was therefore imposed.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The trial judge&apos;s conclusion that the defendants were entitled to use the plaintiff&apos;s barge information when considering all of the various options for the fuel dock narrowed the issue to whether the defendants made use of the financial statements or confidential aspects of the “operational plan” for purposes other than assessing the viability of the plaintiff as a tenant. <eos/><bos/>Briefing notes prepared for a meeting with Chief Pollard included a reference to information from figures extracted from the plaintiff&apos;s 2005 income statement and reflected use of the financial statements for an unauthorized purpose. <eos/><bos/>The use of the information in the financial statements as part of a briefing note for a meeting to consider whether the Limited Partnership should take over the marine fuel dock was not a permitted use of this confidential information. <eos/><bos/>The question whether the information was actually factored in to the decision to purchase and run the fuel barge was another matter. <eos/><bos/>The trial judge considered it unlikely that there was substantive discussion at this brief meeting on the question of whether the Limited Partnership should take over the fuel dock business, and highly unlikely that any use was made during this meeting of the plaintiff&apos;s 2005 financial figures.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><head style="l" parent="appendix.body"><bop/><bos/><headtext><bold>Reasons Given by Court for Award:</bold></headtext><eos/><eop/></head><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The only misuse of confidential information demonstrated was very limited, namely, the inclusion of data from the 2005 financial statements in the Weiwaikum briefing note. <eos/><bos/>There was no evidence that the very limited misuse of the confidential information played any part in the decision taken to acquire the fuel barge and operate the marine fuel business. <eos/><bos/>The plaintiff was in no different position than it would have been in had the misuse not occurred. <eos/><bos/>The plaintiff failed to prove damages on a “common sense view of causation.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The plaintiff was not entitled to compensatory damages for the defendants&apos;

In March 2009, when the plaintiff demanded return of its files, the defendant denied that NP was in possession of any Graham documents. <eos/><bos/>However, the defendants eventually consented to an order, under which they were to return all documents, including copies. <eos/><bos/>Most of the copied files were returned but about 40 had by then been destroyed. <eos/><bos/>The destroyed files were likely the ones for which no transfer had been obtained. <eos/><bos/>Every file that was returned contained a transfer form in favour of NP.</paratext><eos/><eop/></para><head style="l" parent="appendix.body"><bop/><bos/><headtext><bold>Reasons Given by Court for Award:</bold></headtext><eos/><eop/></head><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>Taking and using confidential information is clearly a breach. <eos/><bos/>Nunes and Pottinger were in breach of a departing employee&apos;s duty of good faith and confidentiality not to misuse confidential information obtained from their former employer. <eos/><bos/>Nunes, Pottinger and NP were jointly and severally liable for misuse of confidential information to obtain the transfer of pre-need contracts. <eos/><bos/>The plaintiff must be compensated for the loss of future income those contracts represented, less the portion of that income that would have gone to NP even in the absence of wrongful conduct.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>There was obviously no way to determine with any certainty how many pre-need contracts would have been transferred if NP had waited for individual clients to initiate the process. <eos/><bos/>There was no doubt that Nunes&apos; standing in the community would have led some clients to transfer their pre-need contracts. <eos/><bos/>The best guide to what would likely have happened can be found in the actual experience of the two funeral homes in competing for new pre-need contracts in 2009 and 2010. <eos/><bos/>The remaining 208 customers, or 67.5 per cent, obviously were favorably disposed to transferring their files to NP. However, in the absence of economic or other pressing need to consider the matter, they would not necessarily have done anything about it. <eos/><bos/>It was reasonable to assume that only about half of that group would have actually made the effort to find their documents and contact NP about transferring their policies. <eos/><bos/>That would leave NP with 104, or about one third of the total pre-need contracts. <eos/><bos/>It was appropriate to reduce the expert&apos;s calculation by half to represent a transfer rate of about one third per cent, resulting in an award of $263,000 for the loss of the transferred pre-need business.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The plaintiff failed to prove a loss of business after October 1, 2008, except for the loss of new pre-need contracts between that date and the end of 2008. <eos/><bos/>The diversion of business by Nunes likely resulted in a loss of nine such contracts. <eos/><bos/>The expert&apos;s calculations, based on an assumed loss of 15 contracts, showed a present value of lost future income of $18,028, plus lost “marketing allowance,” which is paid by Assurant on sale of the contracts, of $6,616. <eos/><bos/>Pro-rating that amount for nine contracts produces a loss of approximately $14,800.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><head style="l" parent="appendix.body"><bop/><bos/><label.name><bold>§ </bold></label.name><label.designator><bold>B:25.</bold></label.designator><headtext><bold>GasTOPS Ltd. v.

misuse of its confidential client information.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The plaintiff had not produced any agreements with the cruise lines or other documents to support its claims for the loss of incentive fees and advertising contributions. <eos/><bos/>The amounts claimed were significant. <eos/><bos/>The plaintiff had not suggested that no records existed. <eos/><bos/>In these circumstances, the plaintiff failed to prove its claims for lost incentive fees and advertising contributions. <eos/><bos/>Accordingly, the plaintiff&apos;s claim was reduced by $40,000 to remove the amounts sought for incentive fees and advertising contributions.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>Further adjustments were necessary to allow for bookings cancelled or transferred for reasons unconnected with the defendants&apos; misuse of the plaintiff&apos;s confidential information, and to deduct cancelled or transferred cruises of customers who were personal contacts of the sales agents. <eos/><bos/>The damages under this head were assessed $120,000.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The plaintiff&apos;s damages flowing from the defendants&apos; past and anticipated future use of the plaintiff&apos;s client contact information were estimated at $1,568,000. <eos/><bos/>The plaintiff&apos;s loss was calculated for September 2006 through 2013, a period of seven years and four months.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The quantification of the plaintiff&apos;s damages over so long a period was excessive. <eos/><bos/>Even without the misappropriation of any customer contact information, the cruise specialists, with the assistance of the corporate defendants&apos; advertising resources would have re-established contact with many of their key customers in a short time. <eos/><bos/>The customers&apos; primary loyalty is to the particular agent with whom they have a relationship.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The determination of an attrition rate is specific to the facts in each case. <eos/><bos/>Here, the close personal connection between client and cruise booking specialists, the loyalty of the client to the cruise booking specialist rather than the travel agency, and the ease of mobility of client and cruise booking specialist all militated in favour of an attrition rate greater than 15%. <eos/><bos/>An attrition rate of 25% was realistic.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>Because it was unlikely that the plaintiff would have retained 100% of its clients in 2006, the use of 1,670 client bookings as a starting point for the determination of the plaintiff&apos;s loss was flawed.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The assumptions by the plaintiff&apos; expert witness that but for the individual defendants&apos; misappropriation of confidential client information, the plaintiff would have retained 100% of its customers, and that the plaintiff&apos;s loss extended over seven years and four months were neither sound nor supported by the evidence. <eos/><bos/>Further, the selection of a 15% annual attrition rate failed to adequately reflect the loyalty of customers to particular cruise specialists with whom they deal and the ease of mobility of both customer and cruise specialist. <eos/><bos/>The report did not provide a reliable estimate of the plaintiff&apos;s actual loss.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The duration of the plaintiff&apos;s compensable loss should reflect the principle that an award of damages is intended to restore the plaintiff to the position it would have enjoyed had the tort not occurred and/or the contract had been performed. <eos/><bos/>The factors specific to that determination included the normal rate of attrition of clients, the mobility of sales agents in the travel industry, the effect of other competition in the market place, the strength and duration of the relationship between sales agents and their clients, the time required for departing sales agents to find a new travel agency and begin to compete fairly, the ability of departed sales agents to solicit and acquire customers, including former customers through lawful advertising and the principle that the public interest in promoting free competition militates against unduly extending the duration of the damages. <eos/><bos/>Weighing all of these factors, the reasonable period for the assessment of damages was from September 2006 through December 2009.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The assessment of damages began by adjusting the estimate to reflect the 60% retention rate, 25% client attrition rate commencing in 2007 and compounding from year to year, and the duration period of three years and four months. <eos/><bos/>Damages must be assessed rather than calculated with precision. <eos/><bos/>The adoption of a 60% retention rate and a 25% attrition rate gives considerable weight to the negative contingencies. <eos/><bos/>The plaintiff was awarded damages for lost bookings from September 2006 through December 2009 in the amount of $470,000.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><head style="l" parent="appendix.body"><bop/><bos/><label.name><bold>§ </bold></label.name><label.designator><bold>B:28.</bold></label.designator><headtext><bold>Zesta Engineering Ltd. v.

Facts:</bold></headtext><eos/><eop/></head><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>W was employed by Stonetile from 1992 until January, 2001. <eos/><bos/>In 2003, he started a company, Castcon Ltd., to produce and sell a similar product to Stonetile, a cement exterior moulding system for buildings.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>Stonetile took sufficient steps to guard its production process as confidential, to meet the onus it carries as the plaintiff to prove that the production process was confidential information.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The information was all conveyed from Stonetile to Robert Will in the context of an employer/employee relationship. <eos/><bos/>The information was given to an employee, and at a later date, the employee was requested to and did sign a confidential understanding.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><head style="l" parent="appendix.body"><bop/><bos/><headtext><bold>Reasons Given by Court for Award:</bold></headtext><eos/><eop/></head><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>W&apos;s position as production supervisor or his involvement in the management or the executive committee, in the context of Stonetile&apos;s actual circumstances, did not mean that W stood in a fiduciary capacity to Stonetile, such that in addition to his employment obligations, he owed fiduciary duties.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The circumstances of W, as an employee getting detailed production information, who signed an understanding of confidentiality document requested by the employer would convey to the ordinary person that the parties were aware the employer was imparting knowledge it felt was confidential. <eos/><bos/>The requirement to sign the understanding clearly communicated that there were aspects of the process, learnt through experience, that Stonetile did not consider that the employee was free to pass onto others.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>W and then Castcon, with whom he did not stand at arm&apos;s length and who received the information knowing the circumstances of how it was communicated to W did misuse the information. <eos/><bos/>The information and process he had learned through his employment allowed him to fast track his development. <eos/><bos/>After some small but not significant experimentation, Castcon defaulted to essentially the same production methods based on building master moulds, and using plastic forming to create plastic forms to fill with cement to produce an exterior cladding system to attach to buildings. <eos/><bos/>The information provided the classic “springboard” effect. <eos/><bos/>There were some variations in the process and product between Stonetile and Castcon. <eos/><bos/>However, most of the differences are small variations on a very similar theme. <eos/><bos/>Although Castcon has developed somewhat differently from Stonetile, it was offering very similar products as Stonetile, to a similar market in Calgary.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The evidence did not support any suggestion that Castcon went head on with Stonetile with customers who were known to W during his employment there. <eos/><bos/>Castcon was directly competing with Stonetile in Calgary, Alberta, which was Stonetile&apos;s primary place for business and sales.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>A remedy must be designed to compensate the plaintiff for the misuse of its information, which led Castcon to springboard into a position to be able to start production more quickly than would otherwise have been the case. <eos/><bos/>The other aspect that has to be considered is the fact that the springboard effect may not only reduce the time to reach commercial production of a product, but it also may take significant risks out of going into business. <eos/><bos/>With the knowledge of the process and product, and the knowledge and experience gained from employment, a person may risk capital much more freely than the first person to develop the product, who puts more at risk in the face of uncertainty of whether the product will be successful, while also not knowing if there will be a commercial market. <eos/><bos/>W while holding a full-time job, was able to bring Castcon from theory to first commercial sales in sixteen months. <eos/><bos/>He was able to develop the lucrative Castlerock tile part of Castcon&apos;s business in a maximum of five months and to produce slate tiles with included thirteen inch hangers within another three months.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The confidential information that W took from Stonetile and gave to Castcon gave that company a one year head start from where it would have been, had it started from square one, and worked only with the individual bits of information in the public domain, and put them together to attempt to develop the products it now produces.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>It is very difficult to determine the value of the one year head start. <eos/><bos/>No expert evidence was called to assist the court. <eos/><bos/>Stonetile&apos;s financial information did not help the Court to quantify a direct loss to Stonetile. <eos/><bos/>Obviously the gross profit from Castcon&apos;s first year of operation was not the correct amount, as small companies starting out usually run at a loss as they get off the ground. <eos/><bos/>The average annual gross profit for the years 2004 up to and inclusive of 2009 was $111,345. <eos/><bos/>That was likely the most fair estimate of the annual gross profits to be earned. <eos/><bos/>A fair assessment of damages for the one year head start in this case for the misuse of confidential information was the amount of $111,345.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><head style="l" parent="appendix.body"><bop/><bos/><label.name><bold>§

breaches.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>There can be no recovery for lost profits caused simply because a new flag and banner company entered the Calgary market. <eos/><bos/>Competition <ital>per se</ital> is not a compensable harm. <eos/><bos/>Even key employees are allowed to compete, especially in the absence of a non-competition agreement. <eos/><bos/>Damages are only recoverable when caused by a breach of a recognized duty.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The plaintiff could not recover for the lost profits claimed because a majority of the loss claimed was attributable to the fact of competition alone. <eos/><bos/>It was difficult to assess what loss, if any, was generated by the use of the Flag Works&apos; customer list. <eos/><bos/>However, where injury has been suffered in a complex commercial setting, a flexible and imaginative approach to the assessment of damages is appropriate. <eos/><bos/>The key in determining damages in an action for misuse of confidential information is distinguishing between losses attributable to the employee&apos;s misconduct, and those that are the result of other intervening causes. <eos/><bos/>The Flag Works&apos;s customer list provided valuable information as it was a grouping of potential purchasers for flags and banners who had already purchased such products; it provided timesaving contact information; and may have included notes concerning the needs and preferences of various customers.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The use of the Flag Works customer list by Finlay, the promotional materials and the fax out caused a certain level of loss to Flag Works. <eos/><bos/>There were, however, numerous factors that undermined that common sense assumption and reduced the amount of loss attributable to the misuse of confidential information.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>First, loss arising from competition alone cannot be claimed under this approach either. <eos/><bos/>Second, losses caused by the departure of these employees alone cannot be claimed. <eos/><bos/>Third, Finlay was successful at sales because she developed strong personal relationships; her customers “loved her” and as a result she had a large and loyal customer base. <eos/><bos/>It is likely that some of these customers would have chosen to continue to do business with her because of their good working relationship even if she had not taken the customer list. <eos/><bos/>Fourth, there could not be recovery for the sales that would have been lost because Ms. Flock was away or because Mr. Morgan was doing two full time jobs and had limited experience in production. <eos/><bos/>Fifth, the list was of minimal assistance in securing clients, led to few actual sales and was not the cause of substantial loss.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>Only modest recovery was warranted. <eos/><bos/>Damages of $15,000 for the misuse of the confidential information were awarded to be split between Finlay and Holt. <eos/><bos/>This amount was based loosely on the lost sales for one year, the percentage of traditional profits, and was discounted. <eos/><bos/>Apportionment was equal because while Finlay took and made minimal use of the list, Holt used it for the fax out, which had a wide distribution.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><head style="l" parent="appendix.body"><bop/><bos/><label.name><bold>§ </bold></label.name><label.designator><bold>B:33.</bold></label.designator><headtext><bold>Jones v.

The parties expected W to stay on at the salon as a part-time hairstylist without management responsibilities. <eos/><bos/>Within months of selling the salon, W found herself unhappy working there as a mere stylist. <eos/><bos/>W planned her exit from Axiom carefully, and in advance. <eos/><bos/>She made arrangements with P to work at her salon before P even completed the purchase. <eos/><bos/>W began contacting her clients, using the list she had had printed out from the Axiom database. <eos/><bos/>Only a handful of W&apos;s clients remained loyal to Axiom. <eos/><bos/>The economic effects on Axiom were significant. <eos/><bos/>W was well aware that the database was confidential, and that stylists were not entitled to access it. <eos/><bos/>She then used the client list to contact her clients, and to ensure that they continued with her rather than with Axiom.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><head style="l" parent="appendix.body"><bop/><bos/><headtext><bold>Reasons Given by Court for Award:</bold></headtext><eos/><eop/></head><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The court did not agree that W assumed the obligations of a fiduciary following the sale of Axiom. <eos/><bos/>She was a mere employee in the aftermath of the sale. <eos/><bos/>She played no part in the management of the company, and exercised no supervisory role over employees.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>P was one of the top three stylists at Axiom, in terms of revenue, but she was neither a director, manager, nor even a “key employee” such as to attract special fiduciary duties.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The claim against W was allowed on the basis that she wrongfully appropriated database information that was the property of the plaintiffs</paratext><eos/><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The evidence did not provide any method of accurately quantifying the damages caused to the plaintiffs as a result of W&apos;s wrongful appropriation of client lists. <eos/><bos/>Most of the plaintiffs&apos; decrease in business following the departure of the two stylists was attributable to P&apos;s departure. <eos/><bos/>As P did not breach any duty to the plaintiffs, it followed that they were not entitled to any recovery for the bulk of their financial setback. <eos/><bos/>The loss attributable to W&apos;s departure was better estimated by looking at her subsequent income than by looking at Axiom&apos;s decrease in revenues or profits. <eos/><bos/>For the years 2000 to 2003, W&apos;s income was approximately $23,000 per year. <eos/><bos/>There was some evidence to suggest that, as a rule of thumb, 30% of a stylist&apos;s customers remain with a salon when a stylist leaves. <eos/><bos/>The proportion would have been smaller, due to the personal loyalty and longstanding nature of W&apos;s customers. <eos/><bos/>As well, due to her relatively small client base, she would have been able to contact a large proportion of her clients even if she had not appropriated client lists.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><head style="l" parent="appendix.body"><bop/><bos/><label.name><bold>§ </bold></label.name><label.designator><bold>B:35.</bold></label.designator><headtext><bold>Calian Technology Ltd. v.

surreptitiously copied extensively from the files and computer records of APA for the purpose of facilitating the operation of the business of Dominium.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>None of the Defendant appraisers had had any appraisal experience prior to their engagement by APA. <eos/><bos/>In the fall of 1997, the individual Defendants undertook a systematic operation to copy and remove from the premises of APA master files, appraisal comparables, and forms and precedents which APA had established, including copies of the software programs for systems and storage of data in use by APA for the operation of its appraisal business. <eos/><bos/>This copying and removal was done by each of the Defendants while employed with APA, both during and after working hours. <eos/><bos/>Most of the hard copy duplication was performed on the photocopier of APA using APA paper as well as paper brought in for that purpose by the Defendants. <eos/><bos/>Computer data was copied by Thiem onto 25 disks provided by Osske for that purpose. <eos/><bos/>They continually utilized the materials removed from APA in the business of Dominium until receipt of a notice of the Anton Pillar Order which was served upon them November 27, 1998. <eos/><bos/>Dominium relied on the APA precedents and systems in the creation of its appraisal reports. <eos/><bos/>Dominium completed 973 appraisals in 1998, which included 20 farms and 9 four plexes and generated $230,662 in revenues. <eos/><bos/>In 1999, 1380 appraisals were completed including 15 farms and 8 four plexes generating gross revenues of $298,225. <eos/><bos/>In 2000, Dominium did 1018 appraisals including 19 farms and 8 four plexes realizing gross revenues of $212,506.94.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><head style="l" parent="appendix.body"><bop/><bos/><headtext><bold>Reasons Given by Court for Award:</bold></headtext><eos/><eop/></head><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>Each of the individual Defendants was in breach of a fiduciary duty they owed to their employer APA. <eos/><bos/>Upon the recruitment of Thiem, they gained complete access to all the computer records and programs of APA. <eos/><bos/>With that access, they gained very considerable power to affect the business of their employer. <eos/><bos/>The Defendants could and did unilaterally exercise that power to affect the legal interests of APA by copying and removing business records and systems from APA to assist the operations of Dominium. <eos/><bos/>The actions of each of the individual Defendants constituted a misuse of the confidential information belonging to APA. <eos/><bos/>That information was secretly assembled by the Defendants acting in concert for the specific purpose of facilitating the establishment of Dominium, as a competitor to APA. <eos/><bos/>Dominium applied the APA system “holus bolus” to the conduct of its business from the time that company opened for business to and even after service of the Anton Pillar Order.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>Any attempt to award damages to APA for actual losses incurred as a result of the misconduct of the Defendants would be an entirely inappropriate response to their breach of duty. <eos/><bos/>Dominium and the individual Defendant appraisers had been unjustly enriched by their use of the property of APA in competition with that company. <eos/><bos/>The only appropriate remedy in the circumstances was to require those Defendants to disgorge completely the benefit of that unjust enrichment. <eos/><bos/>By misappropriating APA&apos;s property, Dominium was clearly in an advantaged position over any other competitor entering the appraisal business in that market. <eos/><bos/>In addition, some portions of the APA property would simply have been unavailable to Dominium. <eos/><bos/>Dominium&apos;s ability to perform appraisals in the formats expected by their clients on a prompt basis was fundamentally dependent on the availability of the library of comparables and other information forming part of the APA property. <eos/><bos/>Dominium and its shareholder owners were undoubtedly enriched by the immediate access to the systems and programs of APA and utilization of their library of information. <eos/><bos/>That enrichment was unjust because it resulted from their unlawful taking and conversion of the property of their employer. <eos/><bos/>The Plaintiff was entitled to equitable relief requiring the appraiser Defendants and Dominium to disgorge the benefit flowing from their wrongful acts.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The primary factor to consider was the outright dependence of Dominium upon the APA materials for the establishment of its business. <eos/><bos/>The Defendants could not have created a broad range of comparables for residential properties in all the neighbourhoods of Red Deer and the outlying areas or the library of information contained in the 331 farm files, for anything approaching immediate use by Dominium. <eos/><bos/>Dominium simply would not have been in a position to deliver a quick return of appraisal work without access to extensive and relevant comparables which form a key component particularly to residential appraisals. <eos/><bos/>The strong initial success of the business of Dominium would have been severely compromised had the wrongful conversion of APA confidential information not occurred. <eos/><bos/>Accordingly, the benefit of the confidential property of APA to the Dominium business had been very substantial. <eos/><bos/>The totality of the APA systems and libraries was indeed of the “very special” variety of confidential information because without access to it, Dominium could not have been an effective competitor to APA. <eos/><bos/>The utilization by Dominium of all the confidential information of APA was fundamentally responsible for the initial and continued success of Dominium&apos;s appraisal business. <eos/><bos/>It was the almost immediate creation of a prompt reliable competitor to APA which allowed Dominium to take advantage of the appraisal boom beginning in mid 1998 and accelerating in 1999. <eos/><bos/>Dominium&apos;s ability to hit the ground running through the appropriation of APA property was critical to the success enjoyed by the Defendants.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>Approximately 75% of the income generated by Dominium in the first four months of its operation should be considered a benefit to be regurgitated. <eos/><bos/>Approximately 50% of the revenues generated by Dominium for the next six month period should also be considered to be a benefit to be regurgitated. <eos/><bos/>The ability of Dominium to perform more than half of the appraisals they did actually undertake would have been severely constrained by the lack of the library of comparables and other data and the necessary time which would have had to be expended in the research efforts for appraisals undertaken. <eos/><bos/>Finally, an additional 25% of the income generated by Dominium of the next six months of its operation should also be considered to be a benefit to be regurgitated. <eos/><bos/>While the Dominium data bank would have been developing to a much greater extent in this time frame through the actual experiences of Dominium in appraisal and the program of research through MLS, some restrictions in the company&apos;s ability to perform appraisal work at the volume actually undertaken would necessarily continue. <eos/><bos/>By calculating the number of appraisals ordered in each month as a percentage of the total number of appraisals completed in the relevant year, the Court could reach an approximate determination of the percentage of gross income generated in each of the periods identified by the Court. <eos/><bos/>That percentage was applied to the gross revenue for the relevant year to identify the approximate gross revenue for each period. <eos/><bos/>By then applying the appropriate percentage of earnings to be regurgitated, in each of the respective periods, the approximate total of the earnings to be regurgitated, being the total of this benefit unjustly received by Dominium could be determined. <eos/><bos/>In addition Dominium and the appraiser Defendants benefited by the savings of the cost of generation of most of the computer systems and reference libraries during that period. <eos/><bos/>That cost was at least $10,000 which must be included in the global figure of damages awarded. <eos/><bos/>An award of $150,000 was the fair and equitable compensation required to redress the wrongful acts of Dominium and the appraiser Defendants.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><head style="l"

use of confidential information obtained during the course of their employment, as well as their solicitation of some of the appellant&apos;s clientele before their departure, no length of post-departure grace period would have protected the appellant from the consequences of the misconduct of these employees. <eos/><bos/>In fact, the loss of clientele suffered by the appellant as a result of the respondents&apos; breach of duties almost put the appellant out of business.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>It was significant that the four specific contracts in issue were not terminated prematurely and only came to an end after the completion of the respective projects by the appellant&apos;s former personnel. <eos/><bos/>In the case of GSW, this took three years, for Sowa it was two years, for Quadro one year, and for Hauser one year. <eos/><bos/>Accordingly, the trial judge erred in restricting the period of lost sales to twelve months. <eos/><bos/>Having found that this conduct of the respondent employees was in breach of their respective fiduciary duties and/or their common law duties to their employer, the trial judge should have treated the four contracts in issue as having been misappropriated by the respondents and should have awarded the value of the lost contracts to the appellant as damages.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>Based on contracts with GSW, Hauser, Sowa and Quadro, the respondents earned gross revenues of $530,960.00 in the two years following their departure, while the appellant&apos;s gross sales dropped by $590,000.00 during the first thirteen months post-departure. <eos/><bos/>In addition, the appellant, which had recorded positive net earnings of $152,000.00 before tax in 1997, suffered a net loss before taxes of $136,000.00 in 1998, a swing of almost $300,000.00. <eos/><bos/>These figures revealed the patent error of the trial judge&apos;s finding that the quantum of the appellant&apos;s loss was a mere $30,324.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>There was no reason why the appellant should not be compensated for its loss of the four clients&apos; contracts taken by the respondents upon leaving the appellant&apos;s employment. <eos/><bos/>The respondents appropriated the contracts of two major customers (GSW and Hauser) and solicited two smaller contracts from customers who were in receipt of proposals by the appellant (Sowa and Quadro).<eos/><bos/> In doing so, they also appropriated the effort and expenses laid out by the appellant during months of what appellant&apos;s counsel described as “wooing the client”, for which the appellant received nothing. <eos/><bos/>Those costs were absorbed in the appellant&apos;s overall administrative costs that, on the evidence, continued without significant change during the period covered by the contracts in issue. <eos/><bos/>In the normal course, these administrative costs would have been recovered by the billings for the work done on the job. <eos/><bos/>Accordingly, what the appellant lost was the revenues that were to be generated from these contracts. <eos/><bos/>Its only savings were the expenses of the personnel on the job and any commissions that would have been payable for securing the contracts. <eos/><bos/>To suggest that the appellant should deduct from its claim for damages a factor for general overhead expenses would be to accept that the appellant should be penalized twice.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The court also disagreed with the 25% contingency deduction applied by the trial judge. <eos/><bos/>When the damages claim is treated as a misappropriation of four specific customers who had been persuaded to, and did in fact, reorganize their businesses, there should be no such arbitrary across the board deduction.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><head style="l" parent="appendix.body"><bop/><bos/><label.name><bold>§ </bold></label.name><label.designator><bold>B:39.</bold></label.designator><headtext><bold>Success Realty &amp;

was no longer contested.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>In 1982, the respondent Cadbury Schweppes acquired the shares of Duffy-Mott and, in a switch of business strategy, decided that Duffy-Mott would take back the production and marketing of Clamato in Canada. <eos/><bos/>It notified Caesar Canning on April 15, 1982 that the Licence Agreement (and consequently the

immediately after the licensing agreement terminated on April 15, 1983. <eos/><bos/>Unbeknownst to the appellants, the respondents had surreptitiously discovered the exact formula of Caesar Cocktail at the end of March 1983 by slipping a technical expert onto the team for the final financial audit of Caesar Canning under the Licence Agreement. <eos/><bos/>Despite this knowledge, the respondents did not take any action to enjoin the manufacture and sale of Caesar Cocktail, or otherwise protest. <eos/><bos/>The respondents mistakenly believed that the absence of clam broth in the reformulated

bankruptcy.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><head style="l" parent="appendix.body"><bop/><bos/><headtext><bold>Reasons Given by Court for

equivalent to the sales of Caesar Cocktail during the 12-month period following termination of the licence.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>This was a case of third party liability. <eos/><bos/>The appellants did not receive the confidence from the respondents, but from the now defunct Caesar Canning with the knowledge that its use was to be confined to the purpose for which the information was provided, namely the manufacture of Clamato under licence.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The licensing arrangement expressly contemplated open competition upon termination, subject for a period of five years to avoidance of what came to be recognized as a useless limitation, namely mixing clam broth with tomato juice. <eos/><bos/>While the law will supplement the contractual relationship by importing a duty not to misuse confidential information, there was nothing special in this case to elevate the breached duty to one of a fiduciary character.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>Nothing is said expressly in the Licence Agreement or Tolling Agreement about confidentiality. <eos/><bos/>There was no privity of contract between the appellants and the respondents. <eos/><bos/>The only party with whom Duffy-Mott had a contract was Caesar Canning, now bankrupt.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The respondents did not bargain for the <ital>unfair</ital> competition of having their own know-how, imparted in confidence, used against them. <eos/><bos/>The contract cannot reasonably be read as negating the duty of confidence imposed by law.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The Clamato formula and related processes, insofar as they had been disclosed to the appellants, constituted a unique <ital>combination</ital> of elements, notwithstanding that some or all of the constituent elements were themselves widely known within the juice industry. <eos/><bos/>This was a case of unauthorized use as opposed to unauthorized disclosure. <eos/><bos/>The information passed to Caesar Canning was found to satisfy the requirements of being inaccessible to the uninitiated, and to constitute an identifiable and distinct source of information which Caesar Canning wrongfully used for its own commercial advantage.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The respondents&apos; “lost opportunity” was that the appellants, using these confidential production techniques, entered the marketplace with Caesar Cocktail a year earlier than would otherwise have been the case. <eos/><bos/>The respondents were not entitled to be free of competition from the appellants. <eos/><bos/>Apart from the clam juice limitation, they were only entitled to be free of the appellants&apos; competition which used the respondents&apos; confidential information. <eos/><bos/>A consultant skilled in the art and deploying a variety of techniques could have come up with a plausible clam-free copycat product within 12 months to bring the respondents&apos; commercial “opportunity” to a close.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The trial judge acknowledged that the breached confidences had acted as a “springboard” to enable the appellants to bring Caesar Cocktail to market 12 months earlier than would otherwise have been the case.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The unique features of the respondents&apos; manufacturing process, and its alleged lack of replicability, do not necessarily establish a causal relationship to a financial loss. <eos/><bos/>The respondents were not in the business of selling information, and the “market value” of the confidential information is not the appropriate measure of compensation. <eos/><bos/>That having been said, the respondents <ital>were</ital> in the business of exploiting commercial opportunities, and their ability to make a profit from Clamato was limited by the acknowledged entitlement of the appellants to market a similar product without clam juice. <eos/><bos/>The assessment of compensation has therefore to address the value of the lost market opportunity and, in particular, the lost advantage of being able to market Clamato free of the appellants&apos; competition for 12 months, and not be diverted to a valuation of the confidential information itself.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The Court was free to draw inferences from the evidence as to what would likely have happened “but for” the breach. <eos/><bos/>The key to the assessment of equitable compensation was the expected duration of the respondents&apos; “lost opportunity”, i.e., the economic advantage they would have enjoyed after the cancellation of the licence “but for” the breach.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The Court of Appeal was correct to reject the trial judge&apos;s “consulting fee” approach. <eos/><bos/>The award would not restore the respondents to the position they would have been in but for the breach. <eos/><bos/>The respondents did not lose a consulting fee. <eos/><bos/>They were not in that business.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>However, the British Columbia Court of Appeal erred in being prepared to assume that if Caesar Cocktail had been kept off the market because of its unconscionable origins, the respondents would have filled the void with sales of Clamato juice. <eos/><bos/>The respondents&apos; damages, on this assumption, would be their lost profit on the <ital>assumed</ital> sales of Clamato juice. <eos/><bos/>This approach makes a number of unjustified assumptions. <eos/><bos/>There was no precise evidence that the sales of Clamato juice were affected by the marketing of Caesar Cocktail, and if so to what extent. <eos/><bos/>The reference directed by the Court of Appeal should continue, but on somewhat modified terms. <eos/><bos/>Firstly, the mandate is to assess the loss attributable to the breach of confidence, if any, sustained by the respondents during the 12-month period following the termination. <eos/><bos/>Secondly, the compensable period is the 12 months following termination. <eos/><bos/>The Court of Appeal was correct to start the compensable period on April 15, 1983. <eos/><bos/>The trial judge found that the competition would have ceased to be unfair once the appellants could reasonably have been expected to come up with a tomato juice product independently of the confidential information. <eos/><bos/>The trial judge fixed that period at 12 months. <eos/><bos/>Thirdly, the Referee may think it proper to have regard to the “other market factors” mentioned in the <ital>American Restatement</ital>. <eos/><bos/>It must be remembered that, at the time of the termination, Caesar Canning and FBI Foods had built up a business infrastructure to which the respondents denied themselves access by their notice of termination, and which the appellants were perfectly entitled to utilize to advance their own economic interests thereafter. <eos/><bos/>If in fact the sales of Clamato dropped in the 12 months following termination, as appears to be the case, it may be that at least some of the drop was caused by the self-inflicted deprivation of this business infrastructure, and was not causally related to the existence of Caesar Cocktail. <eos/><bos/>Fourthly, the assessment of the respondents&apos; loss of profit may include consideration of the royalties otherwise payable under the Licence Agreement for the 12-month compensable period. <eos/><bos/>Fifthly, the Referee will have to keep in mind that the objective is a broadly equitable result. <eos/><bos/>Mathematical exactitude is neither required nor obtainable</paratext><eos/><eop/></para><head style="l"

information, in order to prevent them from doing exactly what they did—get an unfair start in the market, and use the information to the detriment of the plaintiff who supplied the information.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The defendants received confidential information, imparted in circumstances of confidence, and used it as a springboard to produce

<eos/><bos/>They also knew who his customers were, and that he had opened up the mass-merchandiser market for therapeutic pillows. <eos/><bos/>They had a good idea of the quantity the plaintiff was selling, to whom, and at what price, because of orders placed with them. <eos/><bos/>This information was used to the detriment of the plaintiff, as Vitacare&apos;s pillow was sold to the plaintiff&apos;s customers, and efforts were made to sell to more of the plaintiff&apos;s customers, at prices known to Vitacare to be lower than the plaintiff&apos;s, thus reducing his share of the

Appeal:</bold></headtext><eos/><eop/></head><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The court had serious doubts that this information, or at least a substantial part of it, was confidential. <eos/><bos/>However, in view of the conclusion that Vitacare was liable for breach of the non-competition agreement and the conclusions with respect to the issues of damages, there was no practical consequence to the trial judge&apos;s finding that Vitacare also breached a duty of confidence. <eos/><bos/>As a result, it was not necessary to address this ground of appeal.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>In compensating the respondent for the breach of the non-competition agreement and for the breach of the duty of confidence, the trial judge awarded damages based on the respondent&apos;s loss of profit for the years 1990, 1991 and 1992 in the amount of $56,250 per year. <eos/><bos/>The trial judge&apos;s calculation of the loss of profit was based on figures for sales, revenues and costs provided by the respondent. <eos/><bos/>Many of these figures were unsupported by documentary evidence and there was difficulty in reconciling certain of the projected and actual sales figures. <eos/><bos/>That said, an assessment of damages will often, by necessity, involve some speculation and estimate. <eos/><bos/>In calculating the respondent&apos;s loss of profit the trial judge made two reversible errors. <eos/><bos/>First, he should not have included an award for the loss of profit for 1990. <eos/><bos/>He awarded damages on the basis of lost sales of 7,500 pillows annually. <eos/><bos/>This figure was based on projected annual sales of 10,000 pillows and actual sales of approximately 2,500. <eos/><bos/>However, in 1990, the respondent sold over 11,000 pillows which were more than he had ever sold before. <eos/><bos/>Simply put, there was no evidence of lost sales in 1990. <eos/><bos/>The 1990 loss of profit was not proved. <eos/><bos/>The damage award was reduced by the amount of $56,250, being the loss of profit awarded for 1990.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The second error with the award for the loss of profit relates to an adjustment made by the trial judge for the impact of increased competition on the respondent&apos;s sales. <eos/><bos/>The trial judge misunderstood the respondent&apos;s evidence to be that the loss of profit from lost pillow sales was $63,750 per year. <eos/><bos/>In fact, the respondent&apos;s evidence was that the loss of profit from lost sales was $56,250 per year. <eos/><bos/>The court therefore reduced the award for the loss of profit from the loss of sales for the years 1991 and 1992 by $7,500 for each year.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>In regard to the finding that Vitacare breached a duty of confidence, the trial judge awarded $75,000 as a fee to compensate the respondent for his time and effort in developing his pillow. <eos/><bos/>The trial judge stated that a figure between $50,000 and $100,000 would be a reasonable consulting fee had Vitacare hired someone to develop the pillow. <eos/><bos/>He then awarded $75,000. <eos/><bos/>There was no evidence to support this award. <eos/><bos/>The respondent did not provide an accounting of his time and expenses, nor did he claim a specific figure or put forward an estimate upon which the court could base this award. <eos/><bos/>The respondent did not call any evidence as to what a consultant&apos;s fee would have been. <eos/><bos/>The trial judge erred in awarding damages in the absence of evidence to support this claim.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>Moreover, the award of damages for the respondent&apos;s loss of profit was intended to put the respondent in the same position that he would have been in had Vitacare not breached the duty of confidence. <eos/><bos/>Expenses incurred in developing the pillow would have been incurred whether or not there had been a breach. <eos/><bos/>Those expenses were necessary to enable the respondent to earn the profits that he actually realized and to earn the profits for which he is being compensated by the award of damages. <eos/><bos/>An additional award to compensate for development expenses would constitute a windfall or double recovery. <eos/><bos/>In addition, there is no evidence to suggest that the respondent&apos;s design had any value to Vitacare other than in connection with the sales of its pillow that form the basis of the award for the loss of profit. <eos/><bos/>For the same reason, the trial judge also erred in awarding the respondent damages in the amount of $5,060 to compensate him for the design of the pillow insert.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><head style="l" parent="appendix.body"><bop/><bos/><label.name><bold>§

b) The respondents did not owe a fiduciary duty to the appellant, but did owe a duty of confidentiality and breached that duty; c) Damages were to be assessed on the basis that the appellant was entitled to be restored to the position he would have been in had there been no wrong, which he held to be best accomplished by an award of a percentage of the profits. <eos/><bos/>He determined the appropriate percentage to be 15 per cent.</paratext><eos/><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The findings of the trial judge were fully supported by the facts, with the exception of his assessment of damages at 15 per cent share of the profits. <eos/><bos/>Accepting his approach to the method of calculating damages, he erred in not awarding the full 30 per cent of the profits as damages.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>There was no error in the approach taken by the trial judge in awarding a percentage of profits. <eos/><bos/>The real issue was whether the figure of 15 per cent was appropriate. <eos/><bos/>Unfortunately, the trial judge did not share his reasons for selecting the 15 per cent figure, and there was rational connection of the reduction of the percentage to any reduced obligation under any joint venture.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The trial judge accepted that had the parties been able to agree on the outstanding items of the joint venture, 30 per cent was the percentage these two arm&apos;s length parties had negotiated as a fair split of profits. <eos/><bos/>That percentage was to be the bonus for S&apos;s part in bringing and completing the land deal. <eos/><bos/>It was, in essence, the finder&apos;s fee for the transaction. <eos/><bos/>The trial judge failed to appreciate that the other obligations contemplated were to be compensated, albeit the exact terms of the compensation had not been agreed. <eos/><bos/>The evidence was overwhelming that the general terms of negotiation were that S would be paid for the obligations associated with the development and the sale of lots. <eos/><bos/>The trial judge&apos;s decision to reduce by one-half the amount of the profit figure these parties had agreed to as a reasonable compensation on the basis that that figure contemplated full participation in the joint venture was unreasonable. <eos/><bos/>There was no evidence to support the conclusion that a full participation would have placed a burden on the appellant that would not have been more than compensated. <eos/><bos/>Rather, the evidence would indicate that had a joint venture been in force the appellant would have had the opportunity to earn sales commissions, to earn compensation for development, and to earn a bigger percentage of the profit.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The only reasonable inference was that the 30 per cent was the figure agreed to by the parties as compensation for finding the deal. <eos/><bos/>The best measure of value of the deal was the figure negotiated by the parties. <eos/><bos/>The fact that the balance of the items were not agreed to did not change the validity of the percentage figure negotiated. <eos/><bos/>It could only be viewed as the figure which these parties were willing to place on the value of the introduction to the deal.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><head style="l" parent="appendix.body"><bop/><bos/><label.name><bold>§ </bold></label.name><label.designator><bold>B:46.</bold></label.designator><headtext><bold>Franklin Supply Co. v.

LAC Minerals Ltd.</ital>, [1989] 2 S.C.R. 574</cite.query>, and subsequent following authorities, but that line of authority seems invariably to involve information passing in a non-employment situation, and it was not particularly helpful to the situation here.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>A large number of the documents were of no use to either Franklin or Midco because they related to things like distributorships that had been terminated or represented historical obsolete information. <eos/><bos/>A great many others were of very limited use, such as compilations of information that for the most part was available in the phone book or from industry publications. <eos/><bos/>That was not to say that much of the material was not of a confidential nature, especially recent financial reports and detailed information compiled with regard to customers and suppliers. <eos/><bos/>However, even that sort of material must be considered in light of the nature of the business that Franklin and Midcontinent were in. <eos/><bos/>It was extremely competitive, the customer base in different locations was well known to all who worked in those locations, and over time competitors gained a good insight as to what each other&apos;s pricing and discounts were.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>White, a C.A., C.B.V. and C.F.A., was qualified as an expert in business evaluations and economic losses. <eos/><bos/>His conclusion was that the best way to measure the losses was to arrive at a determination of what percentage of Midfield&apos;s business would have gone to Franklin were it not for the wrongful acts of the defendants. <eos/><bos/>He assumed, among other things, that the actions of the defendants were wrongful as claimed, that Franklin was unable to use the documents seized because of the Anton Pillar order, and that the Scott/Fieger analysis as to the importance of the documents was correct. <eos/><bos/>White concluded that 85%–88% of sales were due to personal relationships and 12%–15% to the lack of availability of documents and the activities of Endersby and others. <eos/><bos/>Applying those percentages to the sales figures for Midfield for the years ending in 1988 and 1989 and adding an ongoing loss at 10% of the 1990 annualized loss with a multiple of 4.5, he arrived at total figures for damages of $1.8M–$2.3M, including pre-judgment interest, up to March 31, 1995. <eos/><bos/>The defendants called no evidence to challenge White&apos;s methodology or calculations.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The best way to assess Franklin&apos;s loss was as a portion of the business the defendants actually got. <eos/><bos/>The question of what portion of the defendants&apos; business is appropriate is more difficult. <eos/><bos/>There was no particular logic to Mr. White&apos;s conclusion that it should be 12%–15% over two years and 10% for another four and a half, it was simply his conclusion. <eos/><bos/>Three of his assumptions, namely, that the actions of the defendants were wrongful as claimed, that the plaintiffs were unable to use the documents, and the documents carried the importance as claimed in the Scott/Fieger analysis, were not in accord with the trial judge&apos;s findings. <eos/><bos/>It follows that either Mr. White&apos;s percentages or time frames, or both, must be significantly reduced. <eos/><bos/>The plaintiff suffered more than nominal damages.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>An appropriate basis of calculation would be 8% of the defendants&apos; profits for the first two years of their operation. <eos/><bos/>That would recognize the fact that the defendants, by the way they started their operation, clearly “got the jump” on the plaintiffs, but also takes into account the assumptions of Mr. White that were not supported by the evidence. <eos/><bos/>The profits lost for the first two years of the defendants&apos; operation were shown in Mr. White&apos;s report to be $387,038 using 12% as the lost sales percentage. <eos/><bos/>Adjusting the 12% to 8% would give $258,025.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><head style="l" parent="appendix.body"><bop/><bos/><label.name><bold>§ </bold></label.name><label.designator><bold>B:47.</bold></label.designator><headtext><bold>ICAM Technologies Corp. v.

liable for damages for breach of the duty of confidence. <eos/><bos/>The trial judge awarded ICAM $300,000 in damages. <eos/><bos/>EBCO appealed both the finding of liability and the quantum of the award. <eos/><bos/>ICAM cross-appealed seeking to have the award of damages increased to $500,000.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The plaintiffs sought damages from the defendant for breach of confidence. <eos/><bos/>The plaintiffs were two companies (ICAM) that alleged they researched, assembled and presented a concept to create a unique high technology machining facility for modern aeroplane parts. <eos/><bos/>The owner and manager of these companies, Nassr, presented the concept to Eppich, the President of the defendant EBCO and EBCO used Nassr&apos;s concept without his consent and without paying compensation.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The dispute revolved around a concept or an idea described as Project Chipmunk. <eos/><bos/>Nassr conceived an idea for the manufacture and marketing of sophisticated aeroplane parts. <eos/><bos/>The parts were primarily designed for new aeroplanes such as the Boeing 747, 757, 767 - 7 - 8 and the new F 18 fighter jet which was about to be manufactured in the United States and sold to Canada. <eos/><bos/>Nassr recognized this new market opportunity and did detailed market research to determine the exact types of parts that would be required and how they would be manufactured. <eos/><bos/>He determined that there was a shortage of machinery capable of manufacturing these parts efficiently and concluded that the machinery with this capability was computer controlled, three spindle, five axis, gantry machines. <eos/><bos/>These machines were very expensive (approximately $2,000,000 each) and had an 18-month to 2-year delivery time.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>Project Chipmunk had two main elements: one was the development of a machining centre with the machinery described above and the other was to have a central computing centre which would allow smaller manufacturing companies to have access to a central computer that would control the machinery. <eos/><bos/>The computers and programming were expensive and required considerable expertise. <eos/><bos/>This central system would allow a number of smaller manufacturers into a very expensive business. <eos/><bos/>This second part of the proposal would also provide training in how to use the machines.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The plaintiff and defendant both worked towards a proposal to be presented to the Federal Government. <eos/><bos/>The proposal would be a joint venture and was described as the EBCO-ICAM Project. <eos/><bos/>On January 17th Eppich made an offer to Nassr which was a rough outline of a business proposition. <eos/><bos/>He wrote this out by hand and at this time he was suggesting $500,000 worth of shares for Project Chipmunk which included ICAM, funded by a minimum of $6.1 million of DIPP money. <eos/><bos/>The plaintiff would roll his two companies with their $100,000 profits into the EBCO-ICAM project and this was valued at $500,000 worth of shares. <eos/><bos/>The third item offered to Nassr was an additional $500,000 worth of shares in EBCO-ICAM in recognition of future performance over the next five years based on a minimum cash generation as shown in EBCO&apos;s proposals. <eos/><bos/>Eppich and Nassr both concluded that a deal could not be reached and negotiations were ended.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>EBCO presented to DIPP its revised application for funding. <eos/><bos/>This application was almost identical to the project developed by the plaintiff and the defendant during December 1980 and January 1981.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>It was Nassr who brought the project to EBCO. <eos/><bos/>EBCO had not put together the knowledge of the machines, the market potential and the DIPP grants. <eos/><bos/>They had only general information about each. <eos/><bos/>The information was of significant value to EBCO because they were prepared to pay 1.5 million dollars in shares to the plaintiff, of which $500,000 worth of shares was for the financing portion.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><head style="l" parent="appendix.body"><bop/><bos/><headtext><bold>Reasons Given by Court for Award:</bold></headtext><eos/><eop/></head><head style="l"

flexibility to fashion a remedy to suit the circumstances. <eos/><bos/>The court has many options which include an injunction, royalties and an accounting for profits or damages.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>In assessing damages the court must attempt as far as possible to monetarily restore the plaintiff to the position he would have been in had it not been for the defendant&apos;s wrongful conduct. <eos/><bos/>Depending on the position of a particular plaintiff, the damages may be calculated in a number of ways. <eos/><bos/>For example, the appropriate measure may be any one of or a combination of the following considerations: (a) the confider&apos;s loss of profit; (b) the value of a consultant&apos;s fee; (c) the depreciation and value of information in consequence of a breach of confidence; (d) the development costs incurred in acquiring the information; (e) capitalisation of an appropriate royalty; (f) the market value on information as between a willing buyer and a willing seller. <eos/><bos/>The trial judge concluded that (b), (d) and (f) are the most appropriate factors to consider on the facts. <eos/><bos/>The trial judge excluded (a) because the confider lost no profits and was not in the business of producing anything on which profits could be lost; (c) because there was no evidence of depreciation of value as a consequence of breach of confidence, and (e) because the circumstances in this case did not lend themselves to a royalty. <eos/><bos/>The plaintiff had communicated an idea for getting into a certain type of business rather than the production of a particular product on which royalties could be conveniently calculated. <eos/><bos/>It was anticipated that the defendant would create a new company with new facilities and would manufacture a variety of products. <eos/><bos/>In 1981 when the parties were bargaining over the value of the information it would have been unrealistic to attempt to evaluate a royalty when they were venturing into such unknown territory.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>It is difficult, if not impossible, to assess a true market value for the information provided by.

damages on the facts as established before him. <eos/><bos/>Although any one of those three measures may have been used, it would be an error to use more than one. <eos/><bos/>The plaintiff was entitled to be restored to his pre-loss position, and no more.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>In valuing that loss, the person wronged is entitled to have damages assessed on the basis most favourable to himself. <eos/><bos/>In this particular case, the market value of the information, as between a willing buyer and willing seller, will produce the most favourable result for the plaintiffs ICAM. <eos/><bos/>The willing buyer and willing seller method was precisely what the trial judge was attempting to articulate in the balance of his reasons for judgment.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>What the trial judge did was look first at EBCO&apos;s position. <eos/><bos/>In the negotiating stage Eppich committed his thoughts in handwriting which ultimately formed the basis for EBCO&apos;s final proposal to ICAM and Nassr for the proposed joint venture. <eos/><bos/>There were three components making up the consideration of 1.5 million dollars worth of shares in the joint venture company to be formed. <eos/><bos/>The first was $500,000 worth of shares for Project Chipmunk. <eos/><bos/>Secondly, there was $500,000 of shares for ICAM to roll its computer consulting business into the joint venture and, thirdly, $500,000 worth of shares for Nassr&apos;s personal continued participation in the project for an additional five years.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>As the trial judge remarked, he found a hint of the true market value of the information provided because Nassr had provided $500,000 worth of shares for it. <eos/><bos/>In this portion of his analysis of the willing buyer assessment, the trial judge correctly observed that shares in a private company are not as valuable as cash. <eos/><bos/>He did not articulate what he considered a reasonable discount for cash would be.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>Then the trial judge turned his attention to the only other evidence there was pertaining to what a willing seller would accept. <eos/><bos/>Firstly, he considered whether Nassr might have accepted a consultant&apos;s fee under the circumstances. <eos/><bos/>It does not appear that the trial judge made any assessment on such a basis and such a measure of the plaintiffs&apos; damages would not have been appropriate. <eos/><bos/>Secondly, the trial judge considered a claim advanced by Nassr for $300,000 worth of management staff-time and travel expenses incurred by Nassr and his companies in creating Project Chipmunk, which primarily represented all the time expended by Nassr on the project, commencing in the years 1978, 1979 and through the full year 1980. <eos/><bos/>The trial judge considered this estimate prepared by Nassr was somewhat exaggerated and reduced this facet of the claim to $200,000. <eos/><bos/>Third, and lastly, the trial judge considered whether ICAM should be compensated for the unique idea <begin.quote ID="QT_0035"/>“at the time he might have sold it …”<end.quote refid="QT_0035"/> to EBCO and concluded that $100,000 was the appropriate amount. <eos/><bos/>In assessing what a willing seller would have accepted under the conditions ICAM and Nassr found themselves in January of 1981, both the time and energy expended in creating the concept Project Chipmunk, and an additional sum for the value of a unique idea were both appropriate factors to be weighed. <eos/><bos/>Although the trial judge did not make a clear finding that $500,000 worth of shares offered by EBCO when discounted for cash would be $300,000, such a conclusion can, and should, be inferred.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><head style="l" parent="appendix.body"><bop/><bos/><label.name><bold>§ </bold></label.name><label.designator><bold>B:48.</bold></label.designator><headtext><bold>Macri v.

At some point, Ken Graham became aware that E &amp; E was producing a new coffee maker and that Sunbeam was considering purchasing it. <eos/><bos/>The design of the ECM-4 was, to some extent, copied from the CM-2 and the ECM-4 was initially made in part from moulds and tooling previously used to manufacture the CM-2. <eos/><bos/>Some of the tooling for the ECM-4 must have been copied from the tooling for the CM-2. <eos/><bos/>It would be fair to say that the ECM-4was a “line extension” of the CM-2.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><head style="l" parent="appendix.body"><bop/><bos/><headtext><bold>Reasons Given by Court for Award:</bold></headtext><eos/><eop/></head><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The valuation of the tooling and the information were a preferable means of assessing the compensation to Ken Graham than the more difficult, expensive and less satisfactory method of ordering an accounting. <eos/><bos/>The misuse of confidential information in the circumstances of this particular case did not warrant Ken Graham receiving any net profits that might be found to be in excess of what he would have received from Sunbeam for, in effect, permission to use that information.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>Some of the information given by Ken Graham to E &amp; E was regarded by Ken Graham as confidential. <eos/><bos/>The coffee makers could be easily copied by reverse engineering. <eos/><bos/>The part of the information that was confidential was limited to design. <eos/><bos/>E &amp; E already had the know-how with respect to the electricity and plumbing. <eos/><bos/>Sunbeam and E &amp; E recognized that some of the design information received from Ken Graham was confidential. <eos/><bos/>Ken Graham, Sunbeam and E &amp; E were jointly engaged in development of a product that required a free flow of information amongst them but, based on custom, there was implied in their relationship an obligation of confidence. <eos/><bos/>E &amp; E made use of design information it had received from Ken Graham in manufacturing the ECM-4. <eos/><bos/>At that time, all the information was in the public domain in the sense that anybody was free to copy all or part of the product. <eos/><bos/>Nevertheless, the use of the information facilitated, to an extent, the manufacture of the ECM-4. <eos/><bos/>Possession of the information would result in significant savings of time and money. <eos/><bos/>Sunbeam knew that E &amp; E had used some of the design information obtained from Ken Graham in manufacturing the ECM-4. <eos/><bos/>Sunbeam indirectly made use of that information when it ordered the ECM-4 from E &amp; E. Sunbeam also made use of design information from Ken Graham when it obtained access to the Ken Graham CSA file. <eos/><bos/>The CSA is primarily concerned with function and not with design. <eos/><bos/>There was, however, some confidential information in the file. <eos/><bos/>The material, including the confidential information, was used in processing the new file which eventually led to the approval of the ECM-4. <eos/><bos/>The extent to which information given by Ken Graham to E &amp; E and to Sunbeam was confidential may not have been great and the use of such confidential information by them may have resulted only in an insignificant loss to Ken Graham.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>In manufacturing the ECM-4, E &amp; E used information that had been given to it in confidence. <eos/><bos/>Sunbeam knew that Ken Graham had given confidential information to E &amp; E.

improper conduct and the second was that it is the function of the Court to enforce, by awarding damages, the monopoly of the plaintiff, at least to April 13, 1984. <eos/><bos/>The proper approach was to assess the plaintiff&apos;s loss which results from the improper solicitation of customers and would not have occurred but for such solicitation. <eos/><bos/>This must be for a limited period. <eos/><bos/>The plaintiff was not entitled to restrict the defendant forever from making sales to its customers. <eos/><bos/>If B and his associates had started up business and limited their marketing to general advertisements and advertisements in trade publications it was probable that the entry of Viva into the marketplace would have been known by the ten potential customers within a very short period of time. <eos/><bos/>It was likely that most would be interested to see whether the new supplier could furnish satisfactory products at the same, or lower, prices. <eos/><bos/>In all probability Viva would have started receiving inquiries and orders soon after it made known the fact that it was in the market and by one year after B&apos;s departure from the plaintiff and four months of starting production, Viva, without any improper solicitation, would have established its position with those of the customers of the plaintiff who chose to deal with it. <eos/><bos/>The appropriate period during which damages should be assessed was between August 13, 1982, and August 12, 1983.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>Damages consisted of the loss of profit experienced by the plaintiff during this period over and above the loss of profit which would probably have occurred even if there had been no direct approach to the plaintiff&apos;s customers. <eos/><bos/>There would have been a substantial loss to the plaintiff even if there had been no direct approach to customers by Viva. <eos/><bos/>The plaintiff&apos;s damages should consist of 50 per cent of the profit the plaintiff would have made on the sales which were actually made by Viva to customers of the plaintiff in the one-year period ending August 12, 1983, and 50 per cent of the loss of profit resulting from the reduction in price by the plaintiff to meet the new competition during this period.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>If agreement could not be reached, the court would direct a reference to the Local Master to determine the plaintiff&apos;s damages. <eos/><bos/>In assessing such damages the “formula” prepared by the plaintiff&apos;s accountant should be accepted and the discount of $14,274.50 which was allowed to Crouse-Hinds Canada Limited in lieu of reduced invoice prices should be included as part of the loss sustained by the plaintiff through sales at reduced prices.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><head style="l" parent="appendix.body"><bop/><bos/><label.name><bold>§ </bold></label.name><label.designator><bold>B:55.</bold></label.designator><headtext><bold>White Oaks Welding Supplies v.

accounts, in whole or in part, are constantly being captured and recaptured by the various competitors. <eos/><bos/>Secondly, the non-competition agreement which the defendant was at one time asked to sign, but which was in fact never executed, had in it a limit of one year from the time of resignation as the period during which the defendant would not compete. <eos/><bos/>This furnished a fair limit to the period during which losses should be charged to the defendant. <eos/><bos/>Finally, the practice of the “contribution to overhead” by Canadian Liquid Air Limited, the plaintiff&apos;s principal supplier, had the effect of reducing the plaintiff&apos;s losses. <eos/><bos/>The “contribution to overhead” made by the supplier was an effective means of price support and it was available to the plaintiff, admittedly after negotiation on an account-by-account basis, to compensate it for loss of revenue occasioned by the plaintiff&apos;s reduction of its own prices to certain of its customers which better enabled it to meet the competition offered by the defendant. <eos/><bos/>The court took 35% of the gross sales to October, 1979, $10,808, representing lost gross profit to the plaintiff, as well as gross profit for the defendant.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The court applied the figure of 15.25% to each of the plaintiff&apos;s headings, namely, <begin.quote ID="QT_0034"/>“Lost Revenue Due to Reduced Selling Prices …”<end.quote refid="QT_0034"/>, “Lost Demurrage Revenues” and <begin.quote ID="QT_0033"/>“Lost Revenue Due to Inability to Pass on Selling Price Increases.”<eos/><bos/><end.quote refid="QT_0033"/> These yielded to the nearest dollar totals of $12,102, $2,682 and $8,380 respectively, for a total, added to 35% of the defendant&apos;s gross sales, of $10,808, amounting to $33,972.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The court deducted from the total given above 15.25% of that subsidy or, to the nearest dollar, $5,676, giving a net loss to the plaintiff of $28,296.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><head style="l" parent="appendix.body"><bop/><bos/><label.name><bold>§ </bold></label.name><label.designator><bold>B:56.</bold></label.designator><headtext><bold>Schauenburg Industries Ltd. v.

and, secondly, the other defendants against whom liability had already been established. <eos/><bos/>XY sought compensatory damages arising in the period after that considered by the Court in the Original Action after the end of 2008, on the basis of conspiracy and breach of confidence. <eos/><bos/>In the original action, the Court had granted judgment in favour of XY against JingJing, Zhu, and two of his employees, Tang and Zhou in the amount of $8.5 million on the basis of breach of contract, breach of confidence, conspiracy and deceit. <eos/><bos/>The Court had also granted a permanent and mandatory injunction designed to protect XY&apos;s intellectual property and technology rights.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The Original Action concerned a licencing arrangement between XY and JingJing, one of Zhu&apos;s companies. <eos/><bos/>XY granted a licence to JingJing in February 2004 which required JingJing to pay certain royalties to XY for its use of its technology relating to sexed semen and sexed embryos. <eos/><bos/>In accordance with arrangements between the parties, JingJing originally acquired two SX cytometers for use in its semen-sorting business. <eos/><bos/>XY terminated the Licence in November 2008 after disputes with JingJing arose. <eos/><bos/>The trial judge in the original action found that XY&apos;s technology included certain confidential matters including a number of specified components of the SX cytometer, including its configuration; XY&apos;s protocols, and all other information and techniques imparted from XY during training, or otherwise, to any of the defendants in the Original Action or their employees relating to the use and operation of SX cytometers; and, XY&apos;s confidential patent information. <eos/><bos/>Having found a breach of confidence by the widespread misuse of XY&apos;s technology and protocols, the trial judge in the original action issued a prohibitory injunction against the defendants, including Zhu and others, to prevent future use of the Confidential Information, either directly or indirectly. <eos/><bos/>The trial judge also issued a mandatory injunction by which Zhu, Tang and others were to deliver all Confidential Information in their possession, power or control to XY.</paratext><eos/><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The foundation of XY&apos;s present claims rested on its now-proven allegations that the defendants in the Original Action were in possession of information confidential to XY, and that they breached their duty in respect of that confidence. <eos/><bos/>In particular, XY relied on the trial judge&apos;s findings concerning what he defined as XY&apos;s “Confidential Information” in the Trial Order. <eos/><bos/>In the present action, XY alleged that Zhu and Tang continued to breach that duty of confidence to XY after the events that were addressed in the Original Action, and even during the trial itself and beyond. <eos/><bos/>In addition, XY alleged that many other persons, being the other defendants in this action, assisted Zhu and Tang in breaching this duty, and they also benefitted or were unjustly enriched from their actions, although in differing degrees.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>In the Original Action, the trial judge found that there had been “widespread misuse” of XY&apos;s Confidential Information. <eos/><bos/>XY, and hence the Court, were not fully aware of the misuse that was occurring at the time of the Original Action. <eos/><bos/>Indeed, to some degree, Zhu used the course of the Original Action to aid in the execution of his plan, assisted by the non-disclosure of his true activities. <eos/><bos/>During the course of the Original Action, Zhu and the other defendants continued to assert that JingJing had been put out of business. <eos/><bos/>XY did not know that the IND Group continued to use the three cytometers in their possession to sort semen during the course of the Original Action despite the termination of the Licence. <eos/><bos/>Zhu considered the termination of the Licence, in November 2008, to be entirely irrelevant. <eos/><bos/>It was business as usual for Zhu&apos;s semen-sorting operations after November 2008.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The evidence overwhelming supported the following findings of fact: a) Zhu, along with his key employees in the IND Group, used XY&apos;s Confidential Information to continue JingJing&apos;s operations past the date of termination of the Licence in late 2008 to create sexed semen. <eos/><bos/>They did so until Zhu and the IND Group&apos;s key employees concocted a plan in 2010 that would place JingJing into bankruptcy with a view to disguising their ongoing operations and use of XY&apos;s Confidential Information; b) concurrent with placing JingJing into bankruptcy, the IND Group companies (IND, IEI, IDI, CTS and FBI), its employees and Zhu expressly planned to use XY&apos;s Confidential Information for their own purposes in the future. <eos/><bos/>They succeeded in doing so by January 2012, which saw a resurrection of their operations in the Lower Mainland (through CTS), and either a continuation or commencement of their operations in China. <eos/><bos/>These activities arose, in part, from their use of both “real” SX parts withheld from XY and the Trustee, and also the copying of manufactured SX parts (the BSO and tips) based on further misuse of XY&apos;s Confidential Information; and c) the plan was implemented by Zhu and his key IND Group employees, while knowing full well as to the confidential nature of XY&apos;s technology, and to exacerbate matters, while doing so in the face of litigation (i.e. the Original Action) commenced by XY to protect its interests in its technology.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><head style="l" parent="appendix.body"><bop/><bos/><headtext><bold>Reasons Given by Court for Award:</bold></headtext><eos/><eop/></head><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The fact that Zhu and the IND Group employees, both in Canada and China, took such pains to keep their plans secret, indicated that all these individuals were well-aware that their actions were breaches of confidence. <eos/><bos/>In execution of this plan, Zhu and his employees made extensive efforts to hide their efforts. <eos/><bos/>This included: a) lying to the Trustee and XY in various respects and, in particular, misleading XY and the Court about who was the true purchaser of the cytometers; b) making misrepresentations as to the Missing Parts and withholding the Missing Parts for their future (mis)use; c) using false names, in terms of sourcing materials and parts for the retrofitting process of the cytometers, all in aid of hiding the IND Group&apos;s efforts from XY; and d) attempting to remove the serial numbers from the SX parts and making counterfeit labels for the newly-copied parts and machines.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>In addition to copying the SX cytometer parts, the defendants used the newly-retrofitted SX cytometers to make substantial quantities of sexed semen and sexed embryos, all in breach of confidence relating to XY&apos;s Confidential Information. <eos/><bos/>All of the defendants received XY&apos;s Confidential Information knowing that it had been provided by XY to JingJing in confidence. <eos/><bos/>Their surreptitious actions and misrepresentations taken in relation to the Court, the Trustee, and XY to avoid detection of their true activities were indicative of this knowledge. <eos/><bos/>Equity will pursue the information into the hands of a third party who receives it knowing, or later learns, it was communicated in breach of confidence and impose its remedies. <eos/><bos/>Zhu, both personally and through his various companies, being IND, IDI, IEI, FBI, CTS and Ai De, all participated in this breach of confidence.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>Zhu, both personally and through his various companies by which he operated, received the Confidential Information and expressly and improperly misused it for his own purposes through the corporate actions of IND, IDI, IEI, FBI, CTS and Ai De. <eos/><bos/>While the evidence was not sufficient to specify clearly the exact roles of some of the companies, Zhu was acting in his capacity as owner of these corporations in directing their improper activities through the means of the various IND Group employees. <eos/><bos/>All of these corporations took some action in aid of Zhu&apos;s goals, and while in possession of knowledge that it was acting for the purpose of improperly using XY&apos;s Confidential Information. <eos/><bos/>In addition, Zhu and Zhang were participating as “directors” or directing minds of various IND Group companies, and their actions amounted to a deliberate knowing pursuit or conduct to commit acts which could not be said to be in the best interests of the companies through whom they acted. <eos/><bos/>As such, they were personally liable for those acts. <eos/><bos/>FBI and CTS, were involved (and in CTS&apos; case, created) for the express purpose of acting to improperly use and exploit XY&apos;s Confidential Information. <eos/><bos/>There was no evidence that IND, IDI, IEI and Ai De were expressly created for the purpose of using XY&apos;s Confidential Information, but corporate actions taken by them were used to further the improper activities relating to XY&apos;s technology, as directed by their owner, Zhu. <eos/><bos/>Accordingly, Zhu and the IND Group companies, being IND, IDI, IEI, FBI, CTS and Ai De, and Zhang, as a director of CTS, are all liable to XY for breach of confidence. <eos/><bos/>The evidence, as to Tang&apos;s involvement in the plan to misuse XY&apos;s technology, was manifestly clear. <eos/><bos/>Accordingly, Tang was liable to XY for breach of confidence. <eos/><bos/>As with Tang, the involvement of Ai De and Zhang in the intentional misuse of XY&apos;s Confidential Information had been clearly proven. <eos/><bos/>Zhang and Ai De both played a direct role in receiving and misusing XY&apos;s Confidential Information. <eos/><bos/>Zhu, IND, IDI, IEI, FBI, CTS, Tang, Ai De and Zhang were all jointly liable for breach of confidence by reason of their conduct.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The trial judge in the current action agreed that the proper focus was not on the plaintiff&apos;s loss but on the defendants&apos; misconduct. <eos/><bos/>In general, the conduct justifying such an award must merit condemnation by the Court. <eos/><bos/>The general objectives are punishment, deterrence and denunciation, and any award should be rationally related to these objectives. <eos/><bos/>XY submitted that the focus should be on the steps undertaken by Zhu and his employees to achieve the conspiracy and breach of confidence, including being deceitful towards the Trustee, XY and the Court, the violation of bankruptcy laws and the abuse of the court process throughout this action. <eos/><bos/>The trial judge concluded that the case invited an expression of condemnation by the Court. <eos/><bos/>Unlike the facts before the trial judge in the original action, where the deceit was largely within the context of a contractual relationship between XY and JingJing, Zhu&apos;s scheme went far beyond that scenario. <eos/><bos/>That scheme, in part, involved false representations and false evidence before the Court, consistent with the earlier deceit that was part of the Original Action. <eos/><bos/>The scheme also involved a clear plan to avoid document disclosure of relevant documents in the present action to disguise the true nature and extent of Zhu&apos;s operations. <eos/><bos/>Of course, the deceit also involved XY. Zhu&apos;s actions went beyond trying to “pull a fast one” on XY. XY describes this as a fraud of epic proportions, which cries out for punitive damages commensurate with the complexity, breadth, and long-standing efforts of Zhu to cheat XY and steal its Confidential Information. <eos/><bos/>There was considerable merit in XY&apos;s characterization of the matter. <eos/><bos/>Years before this action was even started, Zhu conceived of a strategy to steal XY&apos;s intellectual property for his own gain. <eos/><bos/>The course of his deception in achieving this goal never wavered. <eos/><bos/>Zhu&apos;s tactics were more than deserving of punishment and denunciation. <eos/><bos/>In addition, an award would also serve the objective of deterrence. <eos/><bos/>Zhu often employs various people, including his family, friends and employees to do his dirty work. <eos/><bos/>An award will send a clear message to those who have helped Zhu in his improper actions and those who might do so in the future, that assisting Zhu poses severe risks to them. <eos/><bos/>While the compensatory damages and special costs awarded were substantial, they did not adequately address the highly-reprehensible conduct of Zhu and the other defendants. <eos/><bos/>In addition, it was more than apparent that XY had been severely hampered by the actions of Zhu in hiding his true activities. <eos/><bos/>XY expended significant time, money, and effort in advancing the litigation that, to some extent, would not be recovered even by an award of special costs. <eos/><bos/>The misconduct involved a high degree of blameworthiness. <eos/><bos/>It was planned and deliberate. <eos/><bos/>The defendants were driven by a profit motive and were keenly aware that their conduct was wrong. <eos/><bos/>The misconduct took place over a long period of time, being from at least 2009 to the present. <eos/><bos/>It was likely that the misconduct continued to this day. <eos/><bos/>This was an “exceptionally rare commercial case” where punitive damages were appropriate. <eos/><bos/>This was a very unique situation and the facts to be considered were extraordinary.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><head style="l" parent="appendix.body"><bop/><bos/><label.name><bold>§ </bold></label.name><label.designator><bold>B:59.</bold></label.designator><headtext><bold>TDC Broadband Inc. v.

It was a “Catch 22”: in effect, the government would not give TDC the money necessary for their progress because TDC did not have the ability to pay their existing bills and was not attracting new investor money. <eos/><bos/>Having the only technology that was proven to work was not sufficient to overcome their lack of capital, or business acumen.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>There were two significant aspects of the plaintiff&apos;s confidential information used by the defendant to construct the RFP. The first was the Business Proposal. <eos/><bos/>The second was 5 different aspects of the TDC information in the pilot RFP. The defendant did not include TDC information in the pilot RFP that detailed the most valuable part of the delivery system, which was the overall assembly of the many off the shelf constituent hardware parts together with Dennis Cockerill&apos;s configurations that made them work together. <eos/><bos/>Also, the evidence did not support a conclusion that Seaside had the ability to or did deploy the TDC delivery system in the Cumberland pilot. <eos/><bos/>Nor did the evidence demonstrate that other bidders subsequently deployed a system based upon the pilot RFP information.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><head style="l" parent="appendix.body"><bop/><bos/><headtext><bold>Reasons Given by Court for Award:</bold></headtext><eos/><eop/></head><head style="l" parent="appendix.body"><bop/><bos/><headtext><ital>Reasons for Decision of the Trial judge</ital></headtext><eos/><eop/></head><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>It was mystifying as to why Flam would not have made efforts to engage with TDC at the outset, even if it was only to determine whether they could be useful as consultants. <eos/><bos/>Instead she and Mr. MacDonald went through the back door for this information. <eos/><bos/>There were at least three reasons for their conduct: (i) their negative predisposition toward TDC; (ii) that when Flam&apos;s superiors asked for reports about TDC and the Caledonia project she saw it as questioning her decision not to engage with TDC. Flam sought out TDC&apos;s information to justify why she was not giving consideration to the Caledonia project; and (iii) realizing that she could obtain TDC&apos;s information by other means allowed her to benefit from their experiences without having to engage them. <eos/><bos/>Notwithstanding these conclusions the trial judge concluded that the defendant&apos;s misconduct did not meet the very high threshold for the imposition of punitive damages. <eos/><bos/>Flam and MacDonald did not appear to have acquired any personal benefit from their conduct, nor to have been motivated by a hope of personal benefit. <eos/><bos/>The misuse of information was not the cause of TDC&apos;s bankruptcy. <eos/><bos/>The company&apos;s dire financial problems, including the shutdown of its service in August 2006, pre-existed the publication of the pilot RFP. While TDC information was clearly confidential it was not patented or copyrighted so the misconduct did not offend these types of proprietary protections. <eos/><bos/>The conduct while blameworthy did not reveal the most valuable aspects of the TDC delivery system. <eos/><bos/>TDC lacked most of the requirements necessary to the bid. <eos/><bos/>It suffered from the fact that its delivery system had been shut down in Caledonia and so its technology was scored as not being verifiable. <eos/><bos/>The defendant had no responsibility for these liabilities of the defendant. <eos/><bos/>Finally, there was no indication in the evidence of Flam or MacDonald of any malice toward the plaintiff. <eos/><bos/>Rather, they made a decision that TDC was not a credible business entity capable of meeting the objectives of the Rural Broadband Project. <eos/><bos/>This was a reasonable decision. <eos/><bos/>Any ISP chosen had to have the capability of meeting the financial and technical challenges of the project. <eos/><bos/>When challenged by TDC and by Flam&apos;s superiors over their lack of support for TDC they reacted defensively, but that did not undermine their intended good faith to fulfill the government&apos;s promise.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><head style="l" parent="appendix.body"><bop/><bos/><headtext><ital>Reasons for Decision of Court of Appeal</ital></headtext><eos/><eop/></head><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>Justice Bourgeois dismissed the appellant&apos;s submission that the trial judge erred in not ordering punitive damages. <eos/><bos/>The trial judge&apos;s findings leading to the conclusion that the respondent did breach its duty of confidence were not challenged on appeal.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The appellant submitted that the trial judge&apos;s failure to award punitive damages was anchored in two sources of error. <eos/><bos/>First, the trial judge failed to rely upon the factors giving rise to an award for punitive damages as articulated by the Supreme Court of Canada in <cite.query w-src-number="0492176012" w-seq-number="00037" w-ref-type="IC" w-serial-number="2002056160" w-pub-number="0006489" ID="I7ef5b6908e3311ea8105c4ef24d07c52"><ital>Whiten v.

indeed, according to the plaintiff, despite being aware of the harm he has caused, when they have encountered one another since the event, he has had an insolent look on his face, and had shown no remorse.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>In relation to quantum, proportionality was an important consideration in making an award of punitive damages. <eos/><bos/>Other factors include the blameworthiness of the defendant&apos;s conduct (high); the degree of vulnerability of the plaintiff (significant); the harm directed specifically at the plaintiff (again, significant).<eos/><bos/> Importantly, the defendant acted with malice. <eos/><bos/>Another consideration was the need for deterrence. <eos/><bos/>While the case may be novel, it should serve as a precedent to dissuade others from engaging in similar harmful conduct. <eos/><bos/>A final consideration was the other penalties imposed on the defendant for the same misconduct. <eos/><bos/>Here, the defendant faced no criminal sanctions: his acts took place before Parliament criminalized such conduct. <eos/><bos/>The absence of a specific criminal sanction was no bar to an award of punitive damages in a civil case.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><head style="l" parent="appendix.body"><bop/><bos/><label.name><bold>§ </bold></label.name><label.designator><bold>B:61.</bold></label.designator><headtext><bold>Service Corp.

secret to the plaintiff, which had not authorized or consented to any party or parties either using its plans or copying any parts of its machine in order to produce like machines for use or sale.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The defendant Roberts, a former employee of the plaintiff, after leaving his employment with the plaintiff, obtained employment with the defendant company which was in the same line of business in the Vancouver area as that of the plaintiff, but was no longer active in business. <eos/><bos/>The defendant company delivered numerous copies of the plaintiff&apos;s design plans for the winding machine to Arjay Industries Limited for the purpose of manufacturing components for the winding machine, which components were subsequently partially assembled to the extent that a filament winding machine was 90% complete in its construction. <eos/><bos/>The machine was identical, or very similar in construction to those of the plaintiff, and neither the plans and manufacture of the machine components nor subsequent assembly of the winding machine were consented to or authorized by the plaintiff.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The plaintiff only claimed against the defendant company that the partially constructed winding machine be delivered up to the plaintiff on the basis that the use made by the defendants of such confidential and secret information constituted the same, that is, the copies of the plaintiff&apos;s design plans and filament winding machine produced therefrom, was trust property in the hands of the defendants, to which the plaintiff was beneficially entitled.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para><head style="l" parent="appendix.body"><bop/><bos/><headtext><bold>Reasons Given by Court for Award:</bold></headtext><eos/><eop/></head><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The design plans and filament winding machine were unique, and that the design plans were not only confidential and secret, but also that no party was authorized to use the same to produce identical or very similar machines to that of the plaintiff, and specifically no such authority was given to the defendants or any of them. <eos/><bos/>Whether or not the defendant company, Associated, or its officer, James Ruggles, deliberately or unknowingly used the design plans of the plaintiff, is irrelevant, and the only fact that need be determined is that they did so use the plaintiff&apos;s design plans without the consent or authorization of the plaintiff. <eos/><bos/>The defendants did use the plaintiff&apos;s design plans in order to produce this partially completed filament winding machine, and did so without the consent or authorization of the plaintiff. <eos/><bos/>There has accordingly been an infringement of the plaintiff&apos;s rights to its design plans. <eos/><bos/>As the machine was never brought into production and used, the plaintiff now claims no damages or accounting for profits, but only that the machine be delivered up to it, in satisfaction of the infringement of its rights.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para></appendix.body></appendix><content.metadata.block><cmd.royalty><cmd.copyright><bop/><bos/>Thomson Reuters Canada, a division of Thomson Reuters Canada Limited is
