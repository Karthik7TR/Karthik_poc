Shanks</ital>[<footnote.reference refid="Id73640608e3111ea9d59caa7de6e97ac">1</footnote.reference>] moved for an order striking out the entirety of the Amended Statement of on the ground that it disclosed no reasonable cause of action. <eos/><bos/>The Plaintiff and her common law partner, Stuart began to reside together in 2007. <eos/><bos/>Beginning in May of that year, they became patients at the clinic for the purpose of fertility treatment. <eos/><bos/>Dr. P became the treatment provider to the couple. <eos/><bos/>Shanks was employed as a nurse and she became the primary contact for the couple. <eos/><bos/>Treatment took place between 2007 and 2010. <eos/><bos/>At some point during the course of the treatment, Shanks and Stuart became intimately involved. <eos/><bos/>The relationship between the Plaintiff and Stuart came to an end in March 2010, shortly after the Plaintiff learned that she was pregnant. <eos/><bos/>Stuart disclosed to the Plaintiff the truth about his relationship with Shanks. <eos/><bos/>The motions judge concluded that it would be entirely open to a trial judge to find both the existence of a fiduciary relationship between the Plaintiff and Shanks, to define the duties flowing from that relationship, and to conclude that a breach has occurred. <eos/><bos/>Where a Defendant is alleged to use confidential personal information derived from the treatment of a patient as a means to further her own interests, it follows that the spectre of a breach of trust or fiduciary duty is raised. <eos/><bos/>When considered broadly and generously, the focus of the claim was on the medical context of the fertility treatment and the accompanying trust and reliance that formed part of it. <eos/><bos/>The motions judge stated:</paratext><display.quote><para><paratext><begin.quote ID="QT_0001"/>… This is sufficiently similar to the situation in <ital>Szarfer</ital>, which involved a fiduciary duty arising in the context of a solicitor-client relationship. <eos/><bos/>In that case, the court stated the following:</paratext><display.quote><para><paratext>In engaging in sexual intercourse with the plaintiff&apos;s wife, the defendant was acting in his or her interest and to his personal benefit. <eos/><bos/>Upon discovery of the affair, the client&apos;s trust in the solicitor was destroyed. <eos/><bos/>Such conduct vitiates trust, the essential element of a solicitor-client relationship … I am satisfied that [the lawyer] used confidential information for his own purposes in order to obtain the delights and benefits of the affair…<end.quote refid="QT_0001"/></paratext></para></display.quote></para><para><paratext><begin.quote ID="QT_0002"/>Viewed in this way, the wrong alleged is not the affair, but the breach of trust that accompanies any act of a fiduciary in furtherance of his own interests and contrary to the interests of the client. <eos/><bos/>In my view, this would extend to the act of using information obtained in a fiduciary setting for purposes contrary to both the interests of the “client” and the purposes and goal of the treatment.<eos/><bos/><end.quote refid="QT_0002"/>[<footnote.reference refid="Id73667708e3111ea9d59caa7de6e97ac">2</footnote.reference>]</paratext></para></display.quote><eos/><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>With respect to the allegation respecting breach of confidence and direct liability against Dr. P and the clinic, the pleading revealed that it was the revelation to Shanks of the privileged and confidential discussions between Dr. P and the Plaintiff that was at issue. <eos/><bos/>This might include, but not be limited to, the actual fact of the alleged affair. <eos/><bos/>It might also include confidential information pertaining to the impact of the affair upon the Plaintiff&apos;s emotional state and her treatment. <eos/><bos/>The allegation goes on to state that this confidential information was used for purposes which were detrimental to the interests of a party to those discussions. <eos/><bos/>Courts should view “detriment” as a broad concept which could include emotional or psychological. <eos/><bos/>As well, the allegation that these privileged details were disclosed to other doctors and staff was not limited to those working with the Plaintiff and Stuart. <eos/><bos/>Finally, there was the possibility that the breach of confidence pleaded, even if it were not a direct cause of the Plaintiff&apos;s compensatory damages, might well attract an award of punitive or exemplary damages.[<eos/><bos/><footnote.reference refid="Id73667718e3111ea9d59caa7de6e97ac">3</footnote.reference>]</paratext><eos/><eop/></para></section.body></section><footnote.block><footnote ID="Id73640608e3111ea9d59caa7de6e97ac"><label.designator>1</label.designator><footnote.body><para><bop/><bos/><paratext><cite.query w-src-number="0492175928" w-seq-number="00001" w-ref-type="IC" w-serial-number="2031266395" w-pub-number="0005476" ID="I4f94f5a08e3311ea8105c4ef24d07c52"><ital>Leung v.
