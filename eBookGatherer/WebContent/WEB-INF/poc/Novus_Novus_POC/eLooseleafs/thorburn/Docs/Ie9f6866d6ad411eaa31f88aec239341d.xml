address the difficult economic and social conditions on the reserve of the Moose Deer Point First Nation. <eos/><bos/>The cornerstone of the project was a precision injection molding operation that Schad hoped would provide employment, skills training and a sense of achievement and responsibility for those involved. <eos/><bos/>Schad became the chairman of the board of Niigon. <eos/><bos/>Husky provided some injection molding machines on favourable terms, including two prototype machines under development referred to as the LEAP machines, as well as other injection molding machines that were operating and commercially available. <eos/><bos/>A new LEAP machine as contemplated in the LEAP project was never developed and Husky decided not to take the LEAP system to market. <eos/><bos/>One reason was that when Onex acquired Husky in October 2007, it decided that Husky should exit the general purpose machine market. <eos/><bos/>Work on the LEAP project slowed down in the fall of 2007 when some resources were pulled off the project. <eos/><bos/>In early 2008, new development activity ceased and Husky focused its efforts on the construction, support, testing and validation of the two HY140 LEAP prototypes that were placed at Niigon. <eos/><bos/>During testing at Niigon there were more problems than anticipated and the two machines were removed in January and March 2010.

Schad in his capacity as President and CEO non-competition obligations of five years in duration from the end of the term of the agreement. <eos/><bos/>In the MSA, it was agreed that during its term

Athena used, but rather that all of these aspects together were unique and confidential. <eos/><bos/>The trial judge concluded that there was no independent evidence that the combination of the features making up the LEAP prototype machines at Niigon was unobvious. <eos/><bos/>The combination was not innovative. <eos/><bos/>The trial judge was not satisfied that there was cogent independent evidence that the combination of features was in itself innovative or, more importantly, confidential. <eos/><bos/>There was no evidence to support the argument that what was confidential about the LEAP prototypes that Husky developed and placed at Niigon was the way that all of those subsystems worked together. <eos/><bos/>Further, to say that the LEAP prototype machines at Niigon contained know-how that was accessed and used by Athena personnel without specifying what that know-how was, or to say that what was confidential and used was the way all of the subsystems worked together without any more specificity, put Athena in a difficult position to defend against those arguments. <eos/><bos/>Athena was entitled to know with some precision what the information was that was said
