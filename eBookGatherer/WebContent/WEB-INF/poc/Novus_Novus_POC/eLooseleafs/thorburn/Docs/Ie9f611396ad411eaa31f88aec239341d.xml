The trial judge concluded that Nunes and Pottinger were in clear breach of their duty not to misuse confidential information obtained from their former employer. <eos/><bos/>When a new employer benefits from the misuse of confidential information, that new employer is also liable for the former employer&apos;s losses, even if it had no direct knowledge of the employees&apos; breach of duty. <eos/><bos/>The case for liability of the new employer NP was particularly strong because Nunes and Pottinger were not merely new employees but the directing minds of NP which clearly benefited from the transfer of business. <eos/><bos/>Nunes, Pottinger and NP were jointly and severally liable for misuse of confidential information to obtain the transfer of pre-need contracts.[<eos/><bos/><footnote.reference refid="Id3afd8c08e3111ea9d59caa7de6e97ac">2</footnote.reference>]</paratext><eos/><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>In <ital>McDonald &amp; Bychkowski Ltd. v.

The British Columbia Supreme Court found that Merill Lynch was liable for inducing the employees&apos; breaches of their duties “not to compete unfairly” with RBC and awarded damages accordingly. <eos/><bos/>The Court of Appeal, however, found that there is no general legal obligation on the part of an employee, upon leaving his employ, “not to compete unfairly” and, consequently, there could be no inducement to breach such an obligation. <eos/><bos/>The trial judge in that case held that the employer, Merrill Lynch, bore vicarious liability for the conversion of RBC&apos;s records and for inducing the employees&apos; breaches of their duties not to compete unfairly with RBC. The Court of Appeal overturned the damages against Merrill Lynch but did not comment on the issue of vicarious liability. <eos/><bos/>However, on further appeal the Supreme Court of Canada reinstated the majority of the damages awarded by the trial court. <eos/><bos/>See also <cite.query w-seq-number="00003" w-ref-type="NA" w-normalized-cite="ELLTHORBURNBIs4:15" w-pub-number="0236187" ID="Id3afffd08e3111ea9d59caa7de6e97ac">section 4:15</cite.query>.<eos/></paratext><eop/></para></section.body></section><footnote.block><footnote ID="Id3afb1b08e3111ea9d59caa7de6e97ac"><label.designator>1</label.designator><footnote.body><para><bop/><bos/><paratext><cite.query w-src-number="0492175863" w-seq-number="00004" w-ref-type="IC" w-serial-number="2027566460" w-pub-number="0005472" ID="I280ba6f08e3311ea8105c4ef24d07c52"><ital>Service Corp.
