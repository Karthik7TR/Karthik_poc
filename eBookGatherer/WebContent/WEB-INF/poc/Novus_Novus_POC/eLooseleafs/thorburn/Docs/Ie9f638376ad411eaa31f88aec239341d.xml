restrictive covenants in employment agreements generally, Justice Goodman observed that the case law in Ontario is divided as to whether the standard to be applied ought to be the lower “serious question to be tried” or the higher “strong <ital>prima facie</ital> case” test. <eos/><bos/>The majority of reported cases that applied the higher standard of a strong <ital>prima facie</ital> case dealt with restrictive non-competition clauses, as opposed to mere non-solicitation clauses. <eos/><bos/>One line of cases in Ontario has found that the higher standard of a strong <ital>prima facie</ital> case should be met where parties are seeking to enforce restrictive covenants. <eos/><bos/>In these cases, if the higher standard is met, less emphasis is placed on the second and third parts of the injunction test. <eos/><bos/>Still, other jurisprudence provides that a court need not choose between a higher or a lower threshold but, depending on the strength of a plaintiff&apos;s case, irreparable harm and the balance of convenience will be given either more or less weight; less if a strong <ital>prima facie</ital> case, more if it is simply a serious issue to be tried. <eos/><bos/>Whether the “serious question to be tried” test or the higher standard of a “strong <ital>prima facie</ital> case” is to be applied must be met in relation to certain aspects of the plaintiff&apos;s claim. <eos/><bos/>The authorities suggest that where the interlocutory injunction will interfere with the defendant&apos;s ability to make a living, the threshold should be the higher one of “strong <ital>prima facie</ital>” case.[<eos/><bos/><footnote.reference

Consulting Agreement he signed provided for a one-year term that would automatically renew on its anniversary date subject to rights of early termination. <eos/><bos/>Part way through the second term, CEO Global provided sixty days&apos; notice to Craig of termination of the Consulting Agreement. <eos/><bos/>CEO Global agreed to pay Craig six months&apos; compensation additional to the sixty days&apos; notice, consistent with its interpretation of the Consulting Agreement&apos;s provision for termination without cause. <eos/><bos/>CEO Global paid Craig the first month of notice, but then did not pay the second month of notice or the six months of additional compensation. <eos/><bos/>CEO Global&apos;s lawyer notified Craig that CEO Global was discharged from making any further payments to him because it discovered that he had breached the non-competition provision contained in the Consulting Agreement, thereby entitling CEO Global it to terminate the Consulting Agreement for

prohibited Craig from soliciting, enticing or accepting work from Members and Prospective Members of CEO Global. <eos/><bos/>The trial judge did not consider that this was an exceptional case, where CEO Global reasonably required a Non-Competition Provision for the protection of its business once it already had in place the Non-Solicitation Provision that covered both Members and Prospective Members for one year. <eos/><bos/>The Non-Competition Provision would foreclose Craig from advancing his own business to service clients over whom CEO Global has not asserted any proprietary interest. <eos/><bos/>Also, Craig contracted to serve CEO Global as an independent contractor, which implied that he would operate independently and that his business would provide service to more than one client. <eos/><bos/>The Non-Solicitation Provision was sufficient to reasonably protect the interests of CEO Global, such that the Non-Competition Provision was void on this basis
