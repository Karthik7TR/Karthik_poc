Prohibiting solicitation by Fluent of customers of the plaintiff ADT Canada pursuant to a contractual restrictive covenant; and b. Prohibiting certain unlawful conduct, including impersonating ADT and making false statements about ADT. <eos/><bos/>ADT alleged that the impugned conduct by Fluent was not a few “one-off” events by rogue door-to-door salespeople, but rather was a “top-down” strategy for unlawfully increasing Fluent&apos;s market share at ADT Canada&apos;s expense. <eos/><bos/>Fluent conceded that it had solicited some ADT Canada customers in breach of the Restrictive Covenant. <eos/><bos/>It also conceded that there had been some isolated examples of improper conduct by Fluent sales personnel. <eos/><bos/>It defended the interlocutory injunction on the following bases: the Restrictive Covenant was unenforceable on its face; in the alternative, events since the Restrictive Covenant was agreed to had rendered it unenforceable; in any event, there was no irreparable harm to ADT Canada because damages were an adequate remedy; the balance of convenience lay with refusing the injunction, since the effect of any injunction would create a benefit to ADT Canada Inc. far greater than the benefit conferred by the Restrictive Covenant.[<eos/><bos/><footnote.reference refid="Id440a7138e3111ea9d59caa7de6e97ac">9</footnote.reference>]</paratext><eos/><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>Justice Corbett agreed that the Restrictive Covenant was unenforceable because of subsequent events. <eos/><bos/>The original obligation arose under a “Dealership Agreement” between Fluent and Protectron. <eos/><bos/>The terms may have been reasonable in the context of that contract: Fluent sold security services for Protectron, received compensation for its sales, and was required not to compete with Protectron, for Protectron customers, for five years after the dealership contract ended. <eos/><bos/>ADT was a competitor of both Protectron and Fluent. <eos/><bos/>It bought Protectron and took an assignment of the Dealership Agreement, and was thereby entitled to the benefit of that agreement. <eos/><bos/>However, the agreement did not preclude Fluent from competing with ADT for non-Protectron customers. <eos/><bos/>ADT and Fluent ended the Dealership Agreement and ADT insisted that Fluent return all information it had about ADT customers to ADT. <eos/><bos/>Thereafter ADT rebranded Protectron as ADT. <eos/><bos/>The net result was that compliance with the Restrictive Covenant, with no list of customers not to solicit, would be difficult and would seriously compromise Fluent&apos;s ability to compete legitimately in the marketplace. <eos/><bos/>ADT&apos;s actions, in acquiring Protectron, refusing Fluent information about the customers for which Fluent was not permitted to compete, and rebranding Protectron as ADT, cumulatively rendered compliance with the Restrictive Covenant far more onerous. <eos/><bos/>Even if it turned out that the Restrictive Covenant was still enforceable, the changed circumstances rendered it impossible to tailor an injunction to enforce the Restrictive Covenant without unduly impeding Fluent&apos;s legitimate activities. <eos/><bos/>In these circumstances, it was fair to restrict ADT to a remedy in damages.[<eos/><bos/><footnote.reference refid="Id440a7148e3111ea9d59caa7de6e97ac">10</footnote.reference>]</paratext><eos/><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>ADT proposed a third-party verification protocol to enable Fluent to check whether a proposed customer was one to which the Restrictive Covenant applied. <eos/><bos/>Justice Corbett rejected this as an unreasonable method for securing compliance with the Restrictive Covenant. <eos/><bos/>Alarm security services are sold door-to-door, generally by a seasonal sales force during fair-weather months. <eos/><bos/>Sales are sought at the front door, and the goal of a sales person is to make it as easy and fast as possible for a customer to sign up for security services. <eos/><bos/>Adding layers of due diligence to a simple consumer purchase creates an impediment to sales which impacts a competitor&apos;s ability to compete in the marketplace. <eos/><bos/>It is also difficult to explain to customers and creates a form of promotion for ADT.[<eos/><bos/><footnote.reference

experienced an abnormally high churn rate for customers in western Canada, where Fluent had been its authorized dealer. <eos/><bos/>In April 2016, as the season started, the churn rates skyrocketed. <eos/><bos/>Upon investigation, ADT Canada found that the excessive churn rate was attributable to an unusual rate of cancellations by customers who had been sold services by Fluent, at a rate more than fivefold over historic cancellation rates. <eos/><bos/>These high churn rates continued over the summer of 2016, dipped somewhat in the fall, only to climb back up again in April and May 2017. <eos/><bos/>ADT Canada investigated the abnormally high churn rate for its Fluent accounts. <eos/><bos/>The investigation revealed more than 140 ADT Canada customers who had Fluent representatives visit their homes to try to convince them to terminate their contracts with ADT. <eos/><bos/>More than 20 Fluent sales representatives were involved in this conduct. <eos/><bos/>The sales tactics took place in multiple locations across western Canada, throughout the 2016 and 2017 sales seasons.[<eos/><bos/><footnote.reference

strong <ital>prima facie</ital> case to enforce a restrictive covenant. <eos/><bos/>Justice Corbett explained that in a negotiated commercial agreement, rather than an employment agreement, the courts tend to favour enforcement of commercial obligations of this kind. <eos/><bos/>Justice Corbett concluded that the “employment” cases are also followed in the context of some “independent contractor” cases. <eos/><bos/>The more closely an independent contractor arrangement resembles an employment contract, the more likely that a court will look to all three branches of the general injunction test. <eos/><bos/>The more it can be said that the independent contractor arrangement reflects payment for goodwill, the less likely that the court will place great weight on irreparable harm or balance of convenience. <eos/><bos/>Justice Corbett observed that in this case, there were factors tending both ways. <eos/><bos/>The consideration paid to Fluent for recruiting customers for Protectron was premised on retention of those customers for several years. <eos/><bos/>The financial structure of the dealer agreement would be defeated if Fluent could terminate the contract and recruit away all of the customers it had signed up. <eos/><bos/>On the other hand, customers sign term contracts that contain penalty provisions if they terminate their agreements early. <eos/><bos/>The nature of the interest protected by the restrictive covenant must be considered on the basis of a reading of the entire agreement, and Justice Corbett was not convinced that the agreement should not be considered as closer to an employment contract than an asset purchase agreement.[<eos/><bos/><footnote.reference

magnified by ADT&apos;s conduct in refusing to leave a customer list with Fluent and in rebranding Protectron as ADT. <eos/><bos/>ADT&apos;s motion to enforce the Restrictive Covenant did not meet the test for a <ital>prima facie</ital> case for an injunction because conduct by ADT had rendered the burden of compliance to be much heavier than it was at the time that it was agreed to by Fluent. <eos/><bos/>ADT sought to ameliorate the prejudice of its conduct by proposing a third party verification process but such a process would unduly hamper Fluent&apos;s legitimate activities in the marketplace and would be impractical in the context of a business where sales are made through door-to-door solicitation. <eos/><bos/>If the dealer agreement was terminated, Fluent would have had two ways to know which customers it could not solicit during the period of the Restrictive Covenant: signage on customer homes showing they were secured by Protectron and customer information about Protectron customers. <eos/><bos/>Thus it would be relatively straightforward for Fluent to instruct its sales force not to solicit Protectron customers. <eos/><bos/>When Fluent and ADT Canada entered into the Termination Agreement, Fluent agreed to return customer information to ADT Canada, and to destroy copies of this information in its possession. <eos/><bos/>At the same time, it confirmed its continuing obligations under the Restrictive Covenant. <eos/><bos/>There did not appear to be any terms in the Termination Agreement that addressed how Fluent was to observe the Restrictive Covenant without having a list of the customers to which those obligations applied. <eos/><bos/>In the summer of 2015, Protectron changed its name to ADT Canada. <eos/><bos/>This change of name was known to Fluent on termination. <eos/><bos/>However, aside from the change of name of the company, ADT Canada had not begun to re-brand “Protectron” with the “ADT” name. <eos/><bos/>It had since done
