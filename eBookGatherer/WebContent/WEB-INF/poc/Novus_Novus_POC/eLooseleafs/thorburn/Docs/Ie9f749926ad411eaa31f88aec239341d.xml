Agreement, the professional responsibilities of the Departing Physicians and the ways in which income was earned and distributed were all circumstances relevant to the determination of the extent of the permissible activities open to the Departing Physicians.[<eos/><bos/><footnote.reference refid="Id90ad9538e3111ea9d59caa7de6e97ac">11</footnote.reference>]</paratext><eos/><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>Justice Sewell was of the view that the contractual relationship between the parties could inform the scope of the fiduciary obligations owed by one party to the other. <eos/><bos/>It was necessary to determine the nature of the relationship between the parties and, in particular, the nature of the relationship between the physicians who owned Genesis. <eos/><bos/>The starting point for that determination was the Shareholders&apos; Agreement. <eos/><bos/>The parties intended their relationship with respect to the conduct of the affairs of Genesis to be governed by the terms of the Shareholders&apos; Agreement. <eos/><bos/>The unanimity provisions of the Shareholders&apos; Agreement significantly limited the power of its directors to act in a manner that could prejudice other shareholders or Genesis itself. <eos/><bos/>Justice Laskin&apos;s explanation for the rationale of the strict application of fiduciary duties to directors of a company in <ital><cite.query w-src-number="0492175976" w-seq-number="00001" w-ref-type="IS" w-serial-number="2039181989" w-pub-number="0005472" ID="I746f9f118e3311ea8105c4ef24d07c52">Canadian</cite.query> Aero Service</ital> emphasized that the reason for the rule lies in the power that fiduciaries have to affect the rights of other stakeholders in the company. <eos/><bos/>In this case, that power was significantly reduced by the terms of the Shareholders&apos; Agreement. <eos/><bos/>Justice Sewell also consider that the fact that Genesis was a corporation set up to permit the physicians to practice medicine together was relevant because, as practicing physicians, they were subject to a number of express regulations, fiduciary duties and ethical constraints with respect to the provision of medical services to patients. <eos/><bos/>The most important of these was the ethical duty all the physicians to facilitate continuity of care for patients and the right of those patients to receive care from the physician of their choice. <eos/><bos/>The ethical code and standards stress the importance of the patient-physician relationship and generally oppose the termination of the relationship without โlegitimate reasonsโ.<eos/><bos/> The board of the College adopted the Canadian Medical Association&apos;s Code of Ethics as the baseline for all conduct of physicians in B.C. One such fundamental responsibility stated in the Code of Ethics is that a physician must <begin.quote ID="QT_0004"/>โconsider first the well-being of the patient.โ<eos/><bos/><end.quote refid="QT_0004"/> Rule 19 of the Code of Ethics states that a physician must <begin.quote ID="QT_0003"/>โhaving accepted professional responsibility for a patient, continue to provide services until they are no longer required or wanted; until another suitable physician has assumed responsibility for the patient; or until the patient has been given reasonable notice that you intend to terminate the relationshipโ<end.quote refid="QT_0003"/>. <eos/><bos/>The College has provided a further practice standard titled โEnding the Patient-Physician Relationshipโ that expands on the duties that physicians owe to their patients. <eos/><bos/>The practice standard states: <begin.quote ID="QT_0002"/>โthe patient-physician relationship is a fiduciary relationship based on honesty, respect and trust, where the physician prioritizes the patient&apos;s care and well-being, and acknowledges the patient&apos;s autonomy with regard to personal choice, including lifestyle or treatment options. <eos/><bos/>One such personal choice is the ability of patients to choose which physician should treat them. <eos/><bos/>It is also clear that the patient-physician relationship should not be ended by a physician unless there are serious reasons for doing so.<eos/><bos/><end.quote refid="QT_0002"/>[<footnote.reference

obligations to their patient and respect patient choice, the patient must have the right to be informed of changes to a medical practice and has the right to choose which physician is to treat them, including the right to change clinics at any time. <eos/><bos/>The jurisprudence recognizes that the nature of the fiduciary duties owed in a corporation established to deliver professional services must be modified to accommodate the fiduciary and ethical duties owed to patients and clients and the ethical responsibilities of professionals.[<eos/><bos/><footnote.reference

between the authorities and this case. <eos/><bos/>Genesis was a corporation and the Departing Physicians owed fiduciary duties to it. <eos/><bos/>The solicitation to which the plaintiffs objected in this case was not made to patients but to referring physicians. <eos/><bos/>The Departing Physicians left Genesis pursuant to the terms of the Shareholders&apos; Agreement and received a substantial payment for their interest in Genesis. <eos/><bos/>However, the underlying principle that giving priority to the duties owed by doctors to their patients takes precedence over some fiduciary duties to their employer that might apply in other circumstances applied in this case.[<eos/><bos/><footnote.reference

communicating with patients. <eos/><bos/>They did, however, say that the notice to the medical profession sent out in January 2013 was a breach of duty. <eos/><bos/>The difficulty that Justice Sewell had with that submission was that the Departing Physicians were specialists. <eos/><bos/>As a general rule in British Columbia, patients must be referred to a specialist by another physician for consultations. <eos/><bos/>A restriction on the ability of the Departing Physicians to communicate with referring doctors is also an unacceptable restriction on the right of patients to be treated by the doctor of their choice. <eos/><bos/>It is also in the public interest that referring physicians be provided with up to date and accurate information as to the professional staff of a clinic to

Departing Physicians were entitled to secure new premises for their practices, to make arrangements to permit them to provide uninterrupted medical services to their patients and to inform other physicians of the establishment of their new practice. <eos/><bos/>These steps included making staffing arrangements within reasonable limits. <eos/><bos/>The Departing Physicians did not breach their fiduciary duties as directors of Genesis by taking immediate steps to set up a new clinic once they were made aware that they could not practice at Genesis, provided that they acted fairly in doing so.[<eos/><bos/><footnote.reference refid="Id90b00638e3111ea9d59caa7de6e97ac">16</footnote.reference>]</paratext><eos/><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The plaintiffs alleged that many steps

the dark about their activities, Genesis was entitled to be kept informed of the Departing Physicians&apos; activities to allow it to manage its own future. <eos/><bos/>As fiduciaries, the Departing Physicians had a duty of candour as well as loyalty. <eos/><bos/>In Justice Sewell&apos;s view, they did not fulfill their duty of candour during the 60 Day Period. <eos/><bos/>Genesis did go through a period of uncertainty and disruption after Dr. Kashyap elected to purchase the Departing Physicians shares. <eos/><bos/>However, those difficulties were not primarily attributable to any breaches of duty or wrongdoing on the part of the defendants. <eos/><bos/>Dr. Kashyap undoubtedly had the right to buy out the Departing Physicians. <eos/><bos/>However, she did not think through the practical consequences of her decision in several important respects. <eos/><bos/>The first of these was she was purchasing a company whose most valuable assets were the doctors who practiced in the clinic. <eos/><bos/>Dr. Kashyap must be taken to have realized that much of the financial success of Genesis was derived from the personal reputations and abilities of the doctors who practiced in it. <eos/><bos/>Her decision to buyout the Departing Physicians resulted in the immediate loss of three of its five Physicians, and the likely departure of a fourth. <eos/><bos/>The second consideration was that the number of employees, the amount of equipment and the infrastructure associated with Genesis were all designed to support a clinic in which 4 or 5 doctors would be practicing. <eos/><bos/>In this regard, the number of doctors practicing at Genesis was the limiting factor on both its size and the amount of revenue it could generate. <eos/><bos/>The third consideration was that the Shareholders&apos; Agreement made it clear that the Departing Doctors had an unrestricted right to immediately begin competing with Genesis as soon as they ceased to be Shareholders. <eos/><bos/>The fourth consideration was that many of the employees of Genesis would be likely to leave that company and seek work elsewhere as soon as they were in a position to do so. <eos/><bos/>This was so for two reasons. <eos/><bos/>Firstly, Genesis clearly had more staff than it reasonably required to provide support for a one or two physician practice. <eos/><bos/>Secondly, many of the staff had worked closely with the Departing Physicians for many years and would naturally have wished to continue to do so. <eos/><bos/>Dr. Kashyap lacked a plan for dealing with these difficulties. <eos/><bos/>The lack of such a plan greatly contributed to her difficulties. <eos/><bos/>None of these difficulties can be attributed to any wrongful acts on the part of the defendants.[<eos/><bos/><footnote.reference refid="Id90b27708e3111ea9d59caa7de6e97ac">22</footnote.reference>]</paratext><eos/><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>The plaintiffs alleged that the

nearest cent, unless it is intended as compensation for a specific debt or expenditure. <eos/><bos/>Damages are a matter of assessment, not a matter of calculation. <eos/><bos/>The purpose of calculation is not to provide a substitute for an assessment but to anchor the assessment in the evidence. <eos/><bos/>In this case, Mr. Justice Legg was assessing Moore&apos;s loss and was using Salton&apos;s profit as an aid in the assessment of Moore&apos;s loss. <eos/><bos/>I do not think that it is an error of law to reach an assessment of damages to the nearest cent in those circumstances, but I think that it gives a misleading appearance of precision to an assessment that ought to transcend mathematics. <eos/><bos/>And it invites attacks based on flaws in the starting figures and imperfections in the arithmetic.<eos/><bos/><end.quote refid="QT_0012"/>[<footnote.reference

<eos/><bos/>In such cases, less serious breaches of duty can be viewed as being done pursuant to an object that was itself a breach. <eos/><bos/>In this case, however, the Departing Physicians had the right to set up a competing clinic within which to practice and the benefit they obtained came from that lawful activity. <eos/><bos/>Justice Sewell explained that the Court must be careful not to deprive them of that benefit in any remedy granted.[<eos/><bos/><footnote.reference

restitutionary and the object should be to put the plaintiff in as good a position it would have been in had there been no breach. <eos/><bos/>The court must therefore fashion a remedy that is appropriate to the wrong established. <eos/><bos/>The Departing Physicians breached their fiduciary duty to Genesis to act fairly in the following ways: a) By entering into employment agreements with Wylie and St. Pierre and other Genesis employees while the Departing Physicians continued to be directors of Genesis without making proper disclosure of that fact to Genesis b) By utilizing confidential information of Genesis in the preparation of Olive&apos;s business plan c) By utilizing confidential information of Genesis in connection with hiring Genesis employees. <eos/><bos/>The Departing Physicians breached the Shareholders&apos; Agreement by utilizing Genesis&apos;s financial information. <eos/><bos/>Wylie wrongfully used confidential information belonging to Genesis and failed to disclose to Dr. Kashyap that she had signed an employment contract with the Departing Physicians. <eos/><bos/>As a fiduciary, Wylie owed a duty to disclose that fact to Dr. Kashyap. <eos/><bos/>She also breached her fiduciary duty by conferring with Collings about what Genesis employees Olive should offer employment to while Collings was employed as head of the nursing department at Genesis. <eos/><bos/>The only breach of fiduciary duty St. Pierre committed was her failure to disclose to Dr. Kashyap that she had signed an employment agreement with the Departing Physicians. <eos/><bos/>There was no evidence that St. Pierre removed or misused any confidential information belonging to Genesis.[<eos/><bos/><footnote.reference

this ground alone, the claim for return of the purchase price must fail. <eos/><bos/>In addition, the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that the Departing Physicians set out to destroy the business they had just sold to Dr. Kashyap. <eos/><bos/>The object pursued by the Departing Physicians was to continue to practice medicine together in their area of specialty. <eos/><bos/>In pursuing that objective, they breached certain duties to Genesis. <eos/><bos/>They did not destroy Dr. Kashyap&apos;s practice or deprive her of the right to utilize the assets of Genesis for that purpose.

Physicians disgorge all benefits earned by the Defendants for a period of two years. <eos/><bos/>Justice Sewell concluded that such a remedy would be disproportionate to any wrongs done by the defendants. <eos/><bos/>The first difficulty with it was that it ignored the contractual right of the Departing Physicians to compete with Genesis. <eos/><bos/>Genesis&apos;s claim for a disgorgement of profits also failed to recognize that the defendants were only required to disgorge any benefits they received from their breach of duty. <eos/><bos/>They are not required to disgorge any benefits they obtained from lawful activity on their part. <eos/><bos/>Substantially all of the benefits the Departing Shareholders earned from Olive were acquired from their skill, effort and professional standing in the medical profession. <eos/><bos/>There was no indication that the Departing Physicians received a significant benefit from their breaches of fiduciary duty. <eos/><bos/>The breaches they committed did not make any material contribution to their success. <eos/><bos/>The stringent rule requiring a fiduciary to account for profits should not be carried to extremes and should not be

claims for damages or equitable compensation for breach of fiduciary duty and breach of confidence, the courts do not require the same degree of certainty as in cases of breach of contract or tort.

the manner of calculating compensation adopted by the courts in trust cases or situations akin to a trust, and they relied in particular on the Guerin case, supra. <eos/><bos/>I think the courts below were perfectly right to reject that proposition. <eos/><bos/>There is a sharp divide between a situation where a person has control of property which in the view of the court belongs to another, and one where a person is under a fiduciary duty to perform an obligation where equity&apos;s concern is simply that the duty be performed honestly and in accordance with the undertaking the fiduciary has taken on; see Sealy, โSome Principles of Fiduciary Obligationโ, [1963] Cambridge L.J. 119; Sealy, โFiduciary Relationshipsโ, [1962] Cambridge L.J. 69. <eos/><bos/>In the case of a trust relationship, the trustee&apos;s obligation is to hold the res or object of the trust for his cestui que trust, and on breach the concern of equity is that it be restored to the cestui que trust or if that cannot be done to afford compensation for what the object would be worth. <eos/><bos/><ital>In the case of a mere breach of duty, the concern of equity is to ascertain the loss resulting from the breach of the particular duty. <eos/><bos/>Where the wrongdoer has received some benefit, that benefit can be disgorged, but the measure of compensation where no such benefit has been obtained by the

However, the RFP designers were not experts in the industry and so the TDC information that the Project members sought and obtained provided a shortcut, which the defendant did not have the permission to take and did not pay for. <eos/><bos/>The Province gained from the knowledge acquired by TDC&apos;s principals over an extended period of time. <eos/><bos/>There is an important difference though between what the Rural Broadband Project team members knew of the TDC delivery system and Business Proposal, and what it misused. <eos/><bos/>The defendant was only liable for that which it provably misused. <eos/><bos/>There was no basis upon which to conclude that members of the Rural Broadband project passed on any TDC confidential information to Seaside or the other bidders in ways other than that set out in the pilot RFP. Once the pilot RFP was released the extent of the damage to TDC had crystallized. <eos/><bos/>There was no basis upon which the defendant would have required TDC&apos;s further assistance, unless it was prepared to seek the undisclosed and more valuable TDC information held by Dennis Cockerill. <eos/><bos/>It did not and so TDC could not be compensated for that which it did not provide. <eos/><bos/>The value of the plaintiff&apos;s economic loss was to be measured by considering the value to the Province of retaining TDC to assist the Rural Broadband Project between the Project&apos;s inception in March 2006 and the release of the RFP in September 2006; and also as a product of the intrinsic value of the information that was lost by TDC and gained by the defendant. <eos/><bos/>A way of looking at the value of the misused information is the cost that would be agreed to by a willing buyer and a willing seller where the product purchased was the provision of TDC&apos;s information and in person expertise, together with the right for the Project to use the information for the development of the Rural Broadband project and the construction of the pilot RFP. In giving up this information to the Province there would be a corresponding diminishment in the overall commercial value of the information provided by TDC, once published in the RFP.

particular area, however, relating to product costing. <eos/><bos/>When Zesta began to manufacture thermocouples, it initiated a database program and compiled data to keep track of its manufacturing

exploiting this confidential information. <eos/><bos/>Zesta would have been able to make the thermocouple sales that Kelvin did during this period. <eos/><bos/>In its first year of operation Kelvin had $496,135 in sales, and a contribution margin of $271,513. <eos/><bos/>As with Zesta, not all of Kelvin&apos;s business was comprised of thermocouple manufacturing and sales, however, so not all of

the same ratio at Kelvin, the manufacturing portion of the contribution margin of $271,513 was reduced to between $68,000 and $95,000 approximately. <eos/><bos/>Allowing for six months of improper use of the information would reduce that sum to between $34,000 and $47,500. <eos/><bos/>Erring on the side of the innocent party, Zesta was awarded damages of $45,000 against Kelvin.[<eos/><bos/><footnote.reference refid="Id90dbf848e3111ea9d59caa7de6e97ac">110</footnote.reference>]</paratext><eos/><eop/></para></section.body></section><footnote.block><footnote
