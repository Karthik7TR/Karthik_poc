misconduct. <eos/><bos/>In general, the conduct justifying such an award must merit condemnation by the Court. <eos/><bos/>The general objectives are punishment, deterrence and denunciation, and any award should be rationally related to these objectives. <eos/><bos/>XY submitted that the focus should be on the steps undertaken by Zhu and his employees to achieve the conspiracy and breach of confidence, including being deceitful towards the Trustee, XY and the Court, the violation of bankruptcy laws and the abuse of the court process throughout this action. <eos/><bos/>The trial judge concluded that the case invited an expression of condemnation by the Court. <eos/><bos/>Unlike the facts before the trial judge in the original action, where the deceit was largely within the context of a contractual relationship between XY and JingJing, Zhu&apos;s scheme went far beyond that scenario. <eos/><bos/>That scheme, in part, involved false representations and false evidence before the Court, consistent with the earlier deceit that was part of the Original Action. <eos/><bos/>The scheme also involved a clear plan to avoid document disclosure of relevant documents in the present action to disguise the true nature and extent of Zhu&apos;s operations. <eos/><bos/>Of course, the deceit also involved XY. Zhu&apos;s actions went beyond trying to “pull a fast one” on XY. XY describes this as a fraud of epic proportions, which cries out for punitive damages commensurate with the complexity, breadth, and long-standing efforts of Zhu to cheat XY and steal its Confidential Information. <eos/><bos/>There was considerable merit in XY&apos;s characterization of the matter. <eos/><bos/>Years before this action was even started, Zhu conceived of a strategy to steal XY&apos;s intellectual property for his own gain. <eos/><bos/>The course of his deception in achieving this goal never wavered. <eos/><bos/>Zhu&apos;s tactics were more than deserving of punishment and denunciation. <eos/><bos/>In addition, an award would also serve the objective of deterrence. <eos/><bos/>Zhu often employs various people, including his family, friends and employees to do his dirty work. <eos/><bos/>An award will send a clear message to those who have helped Zhu in his improper actions and those who might do so in the future, that assisting Zhu poses severe risks to them. <eos/><bos/>While the compensatory damages and special costs awarded were substantial, they did not adequately address the highly-reprehensible conduct of Zhu and the other defendants. <eos/><bos/>In addition, it was more than apparent that XY had been severely hampered by the actions of Zhu in hiding his true activities. <eos/><bos/>XY expended significant time, money, and effort in advancing the litigation that, to some extent, would not be recovered even by an award of special costs. <eos/><bos/>The misconduct involved a high degree of blameworthiness. <eos/><bos/>It was planned and deliberate. <eos/><bos/>The defendants were driven by a profit motive and were keenly aware that their conduct was wrong. <eos/><bos/>The misconduct took place over a long period of time, being from at least 2009 to the present. <eos/><bos/>It was likely that the misconduct continued to this day. <eos/><bos/>This was an “exceptionally rare commercial case” where punitive damages were appropriate. <eos/><bos/>This was a very unique situation and the facts to be considered were extraordinary. <eos/><bos/>Punitive damages against Zhu, IND, CTS, FBI, IEI, IDI and Ai De were awarded in the amount of $300,000 on a joint and several basis. <eos/><bos/>In recognition of the lesser role played by Tang and Zhang, punitive damages against each of them in the amount of $100,000 was awarded.[<eos/><bos/><footnote.reference refid="Id91dec228e3111ea9d59caa7de6e97ac">13</footnote.reference>]</paratext><eos/><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>Punitive damages are not warranted in <cite.query w-src-number="0492175977" w-seq-number="00002" w-ref-type="IS" w-serial-number="2039565063" w-pub-number="0005475" ID="I761b2c318e3311ea8105c4ef24d07c52"><ital>TDC Broadband Inc. v.

Flam sought out TDC&apos;s information to justify why she was not giving consideration to the Caledonia project; and (iii) realizing that she could obtain TDC&apos;s information by other means allowed her to benefit from their experiences without having to engage them. <eos/><bos/>Notwithstanding these conclusions the trial judge concluded that the defendant&apos;s misconduct did not meet the very high threshold for the imposition of punitive damages. <eos/><bos/>Flam and MacDonald did not appear to have acquired any personal benefit from their conduct, nor to have been motivated by a hope of personal benefit. <eos/><bos/>The misuse of information was not the cause of TDC&apos;s bankruptcy. <eos/><bos/>The company&apos;s dire financial problems, including the shutdown of its service in August 2006, pre-existed the publication of the pilot RFP. While TDC information was clearly confidential it was not patented or copyrighted so the misconduct did not offend these types of proprietary protections. <eos/><bos/>The conduct while blameworthy did not reveal the most valuable aspects of the TDC delivery system. <eos/><bos/>TDC lacked most of the requirements necessary to the bid. <eos/><bos/>It suffered from the fact that its delivery system had been shut down in Caledonia and so its technology was scored as not being verifiable. <eos/><bos/>The defendant had no responsibility for these liabilities of the defendant. <eos/><bos/>Finally, there was no indication in the evidence of Flam or MacDonald of any malice toward the plaintiff. <eos/><bos/>Rather, they made a decision that TDC was not a credible business entity capable of meeting the objectives of the Rural Broadband Project. <eos/><bos/>This was a reasonable decision. <eos/><bos/>Any ISP chosen had to have the capability of meeting the financial and technical challenges of the project. <eos/><bos/>When challenged by TDC and by Flam&apos;s superiors over their lack of support for TDC they reacted defensively, but that did not undermine their intended good faith to fulfill the government&apos;s promise.[<eos/><bos/><footnote.reference refid="Id91dec248e3111ea9d59caa7de6e97ac">15</footnote.reference>]</paratext><eos/><eop/></para><para><bop/><bos/><paratext>On appeal in <cite.query w-src-number="0492175977" w-seq-number="00003" w-ref-type="IS" w-serial-number="2039565063" w-pub-number="0005475" ID="I761bef818e3311ea8105c4ef24d07c52"><ital>TDC Broadband Inc. v.

key submission in response to Bell&apos;s argument was that the allegations in support of the claim for punitive damages did not amount to allegations of dishonesty, breach of confidence or breach of trust as would be required to justify an award of solicitor-and-client costs. <eos/><bos/>The trial judge recognized that there was no explicit allegation in the Statement of Claim that Bell breached any agreement with the plaintiffs, misused the plaintiffs&apos; confidential information, or appropriated any property of the plaintiffs. <eos/><bos/>However, these allegations must be implicit in the plaintiffs&apos; pleading. <eos/><bos/>Certainly, the Prothonotary was satisfied that the allegations were sufficiently serious and specific to overcome Bell&apos;s motion to strike the claim for punitive damages, stating:</paratext><display.quote><para><paratext><begin.quote ID="QT_0004"/>it is clear to me that what is alleged is that Bell had notice of the Plaintiffs&apos;
