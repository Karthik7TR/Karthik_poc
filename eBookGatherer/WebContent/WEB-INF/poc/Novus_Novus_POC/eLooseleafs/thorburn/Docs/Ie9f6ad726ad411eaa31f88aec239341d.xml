<eos/><bos/>There are no rules of pleading <ital>per se</ital> in respect of motions. <eos/><bos/>The rules do require that the moving party deliver a motion record. <eos/><bos/>Of particular note was the fact no reference was made to the AllianceCare project as formulating a basis for the allegation of conflict of interest. <eos/><bos/>Before cross-examinations were conducted and before argument was entertained, the moving parties had presented evidence relating to the AllianceCare issue. <eos/><bos/>The Applicants had not been surprised by the AllianceCare issue. <eos/><bos/>The evidence in relation to AllianceCare was before the court and related by the moving parties to the conflict issue prior to cross-examination. <eos/><bos/>It was thus relevant, even though it was not specifically referenced in the Notice of Motion. <eos/><bos/>The requirement that a moving party include Grounds for the motion is designed to promote procedural fairness by alerting a responding party to the material issues in play, supplemented by a broad description of the main allegations of fact. <eos/><bos/>Here the notice of motion referenced the allegation of conflict of interest. <eos/><bos/>A reply affidavit referenced the AllianceCare project prior to cross-examinations and related it to the conflict issue. <eos/><bos/>There was no basis to conclude that the Applicants had been prejudiced in these circumstances. <eos/><bos/>Even if AllianceCare could be added as a party, such is not a necessary pre-condition to rendering questions in relation to AllianceCare relevant. <eos/><bos/>The relevance of questions at cross-examination is determined by defined issues, not by who is or is not a party. <eos/><bos/>It was apparent from the evidence that AllianceCare represented an important component of the dispute between the parties. <eos/><bos/>It was not proper for the Applicants to refuse to answer the questions put to them regarding AllianceCare and it was open to the motion judge to draw an adverse inference to the effect that answers to the questions refused would have been unhelpful to the Applicants&apos; position on the motion. <eos/><bos/>The questions refused were directed at determining the nature of the work performed and information received by the solicitor in relation to the AllianceCare project. <eos/><bos/>Answers would have shed light on whether the solicitor received confidential information attributable to a solicitor/client relationship relevant to a matter at hand. <eos/><bos/>The refusals led the motion judge to draw an inference that had the answers been provided such would likely have supported the moving parties&apos; position on this issue that confidential information had been obtained. <eos/><bos/>According to <ital>McKercher</ital>, there is a rebuttable presumption that a lawyer possesses confidential information that raises the risk of prejudice if a new retainer is “sufficiently related” to the matters on which he or she worked for the former client. <eos/><bos/>The rebuttable presumption in <ital>McKercher</ital> is supplemented by the adverse inferences drawn from the Applicants refusal to answer questions regarding the AllianceCare project. <eos/><bos/>The concern was that the past representation by the solicitor of UniversalCare provided access to confidential information that was sufficiently related to the subject matter of the current dispute. <eos/><bos/>The motion judge concluded that the solicitor did receive confidential information attributable to a solicitor/client relationship relevant to the matter at hand. <eos/><bos/>The motion judge also concluded that there was a risk that the confidential information would be used to the prejudice of the client, given that the rebuttable presumption of risk had not been rebutted in light of the failure to answer relevant questions.[<eos/><bos/><footnote.reference
